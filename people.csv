	<em>Michael Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization (WHO) health emergencies program, speaks at a press conference in Geneva, Switzerland on Feb. 13, 2020. (Xinhua/Chen Junxia)</em></p>
<p>
	""This is a very good public health practice,"" said Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Program, who referred to the fact that the government in China had spent a number of weeks pressuring the virus and now actively engaged in door-to-door surveillance, which has led to the number of cases dropping away lately.</p>
<p>
	""You can argue whether those measures are excessive or whether they're restricted on people, but there's a lot at stake here. There's an awful lot at stake here, in terms of public health, and in terms of not only the public health of China but of all people in the world,"" he said.</p>
<p>
	GENEVA, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO) said Tuesday that measures to restrict people's movement in China amid the COVID-19 outbreak are a correct strategic and tactical approach, and WHO would like to see progressive implementation of public health measures.</p>
<p>
	""This is a very good public health practice,"" said Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Program, who referred to the fact that the government in China had spent a number of weeks pressuring the virus and now actively engaged in door-to-door surveillance, which has led to the number of cases dropping away lately.</p>
<p>
	""We'd like to see progressive implementation of public health measures,"" he underlined.</p>
<p>
	He explained that the first objective in Wuhan is to contain the virus at the epicenter, which has allowed space for much more active surveillance, and by doing so ""they don't want virus to return to other places.""</p>
<p>
	Referring to the latest restrictive measures on people's movement in Beijing, the WHO expert said that the city is a central point in China for so many workers to return to, ""so what China is trying to do is while they're getting success and pulling out one fire, they don't want the fire to start somewhere else. So they're taking very directed measures to ensure the people returning to the city are observed and monitored.""</p>
<p>
	""You can argue whether those measures are excessive or whether they're restricted on people, but there's a lot at stake here. There's an awful lot at stake here, in terms of public health, and in terms of not only the public health of China but of all people in the world,"" he said.</p>
<p>
	Starting from Monday, a joint expert team consisting of experts from China and WHO began field inspections on the prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak. The team members are scheduled to go to Beijing, Guangdong Province in the south and Sichuan Province in southwest China to conduct inspections.</p>
<p>
	According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the team may travel to Wuhan, based on their risk assessment and needs, as ""all options are open.""</p>

        <p>
	A group of volunteers in Chongqing municipality, southwest China, have made great efforts to protect the ancient buildings and revitalize traditional villages in the city, People’s Daily reported.</p>
<p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0219/FOREIGN202002191645000061382475194.jpg"" style=""width: 400px; height: 294px;""></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<em>Volunteers do research in Chongqing. (File photo)</em></p>
<p>
	The volunteers, who belong to a non-governmental organization established in 2011, have organized over 30,000 activities and toured along 39 cultural routes in Chongqing in the past nine years to record the city’s history.</p>
<p>
	During their tours along the cultural routes, they found that the ancient buildings suffered various types of damage, and decided that each one of them would follow up on several cultural relics in a detailed manner.</p>
<p>
	Each volunteer would check the buildings under their charge at regular intervals, write up reports on the conditions of the historical buildings and submit them to the relevant government departments for them to formulate plans to repair and improve the damaged structures.</p>
<p>
	By December 2019, the volunteers had written a total of 2,482 reports on 132 cultural relics in Chongqing.</p>
<p>
	Starting from the end of 2017, the team members have conducted investigations in 74 ancient villages in Chongqing in an attempt to spread knowledge of traditional customs. They have helped build museums in the villages or kept journals on the villages, which are then printed and distributed to more people.</p>
<p>
	At the same time, the volunteers have worked together with schools to give lessons on cultural protection to encourage students to participate in the protection of cultural relics.</p>

[Logistics data shows nationwide support for Chinas epidemic center of Hubei], 2020-02-19 15:21:06,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	GUIYANG, Feb. 19 (Xinhua) -- Manbang Group, China's largest freight service provider, said its big data suggested material logistics to central China's Hubei, the center of the COVID-19 outbreak, have been stable, showing nationwide supports to the province's anti-epidemic fight.</p>
<p>
	The company based in southwest China's Guizhou Province cited the data between Dec. 13, 2019, and Feb. 12 that before Jan. 13, goods to Hubei were mainly building materials, food, beverages, coal and minerals. After that, vegetables and fruits increased rapidly, with vegetables accounting for 10.4 percent of all goods sent to Hubei.</p>
<p>
	Vegetables are transported to Hubei mainly from Yunnan, Henan and Shandong provinces. Fruits are sent to Hubei from Guangxi, Yunnan and Guangdong. Guangxi alone accounts for 52 percent of the total amount of fruits transported to Hubei, while Henan contributes the most grain to Hubei.</p>
<p>
	Manbang's data platform also monitored that a truck driver traveled for nearly six days across 4,444 km to transport a full cargo load of medicine from Hotan in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region to the city of Huanggang in Hubei, making it the farthest trip in the country to provide supplies to Hubei.</p>
<p>
	The hard-hit province had a total of 61,682 confirmed cases as of Wednesday. It saw 1,266 patients discharged from hospitals after recovery on Tuesday, bringing the total number of discharged patients in the province to 9,128, as epidemic control work progressed.</p>
<p>
	Manbang is an Uber-like truck-hailing service provider with nine million subscribers in 300 cities in China. Its data platform offers indicators of supply demands and logistics efficiency.</p>

[Communities urged to play greater role in Chinas battle against epidemic], 2020-02-19 17:14:58,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese authorities have urged residential communities to play a more prominent role in the fight against the novel coronavirus epidemic.</p>
<p>
	Communities should rally support from residents, volunteers, property management and social organizations in the joint prevention and control efforts, and become a strong fortress against the epidemic, according to a circular issued by the Commission for Political and Legal Affairs of the Communist Party of China Central Committee.</p>
<p>
	The circular called on community workers to use phones and other devices during door-to-door inspections to avoid infection, and encouraged the use of technologies such as big data and the Internet of Things to improve the effectiveness of work.</p>
<p>
	The circular stressed the importance of mediating disputes among residents in a timely manner and carrying out psychological counseling for the public.</p>
<p>
	It also called for efforts to ensure the supply of protective equipment and subsidies for personnel working in communities to fight the disease, appropriately arrange work shifts for them and explore epidemic prevention insurance for community workers.</p>

Cloud working aids Chinese companies amidst epidemic, 2020-02-19 16:34:13,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	HANGZHOU, Feb. 19 (Xinhua) -- At around 6 p.m., Yu Feiwen, an online shop owner, closed her laptop after finishing work. She and her partners, based in their homes in five cities due to the current coronavirus outbreak, ""met"" every day thanks to cloud working.</p>
<p>
	""We held meetings to brainstorm and share ideas on running the shop, and also maintain customer relations online just like before,"" Yu said.</p>
<p>
	Some difficulties still exist as they are not present in the office, but they are still making a profit.</p>
<p>
	""We work as hard as usual. The only difference is that we work from home,"" she said.</p>
<p>
	In the meantime, other small businesses and companies in China have scrambled to resume work on the cloud. Many employers, as well as employees, for the first time, have to get familiar with telecommuting tools such as video conferences and online office kits.</p>
<p>
	According to QuestMobile, a mobile Internet big data company, the time Chinese spent on the Internet increased from 5 billion hours on Jan. 23, to 5.76 billion the next day, and 6.1 billion on Feb. 3, the first day of working from home for many companies. The time spent on telecommuting software is also growing rapidly.</p>
<p>
	As a result, mobile technology companies such as Tencent, Alibaba's DingTalk and China Mobile have all raced to provide technical support, most of which free of charge, to companies and individuals in need.</p>
<p>
	The number of online meetings supported by Tencent Meeting on Feb. 10 was 100 times that of its previous average daily use.</p>
<p>
	DingTalk said it has served more than 10 million enterprises and over 200 million people. To meet the huge demand in peak hours, DingTalk has added over 20,000 temporary servers and expanded bandwidth to enhance its calculation capacity.</p>
<p>
	Tao Jun, DingTalk's intelligent personnel business director, said telecommuting for many companies has evolved from building their own OA systems to adopting the framework of a ""cloud platform.""</p>
<p>
	The emergence of telecommuting represents the increasing digitalization of Chinese enterprises, which ensures a boost in the market and users in related fields, said Chen Lu, an expert on digital enterprises.</p>
<p>
	According to Frost&amp;Sullivan, a U.S.-based business consulting company, from 2014 to 2017, China's video conference market grew from 5.23 billion yuan (750 million U.S. dollars) to 11.04 billion yuan, with a compound annual growth rate of 28.3 percent. The market size is expected to reach 44.6 billion yuan in 2022, with business management, healthcare and education being key areas.</p>
<p>
	Thanks to the increasing digitalization of companies and governments, enterprise management is also increasingly merging with social governance.</p>
<p>
	Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang Province, has adopted QR codes for the control and prevention of the novel coronavirus outbreak. The QR code, produced in the mobile app of real-name registered Alipay, is based on the register's movement over the previous two weeks and tells whether he or she has been to virus-hit areas.</p>
<p>
	Online health management is therefore realized for government and companies, especially since the massive influx of returning workers is expected.</p>
<p>
	According to Jiang Ruzhong, deputy director of Zhejiang Provincial Big Data Development Administration, digitalization is also conducive to connecting management data between companies and governments for more integrated governance.</p>
<p>
	Lan Jianping, director of Zhejiang Institute of Industry and Information Technology, said that digital transformation will not be confined to the office, but will change production and operation as well in the long run, which will further increase the potential of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

Expressway passing through Xiongan New Area resumes construction, 2020-02-19 17:16:01,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	SHIJIAZHUANG, Feb. 19 (Xinhua) -- The construction of a major expressway traversing Xiongan New Area in north China's Hebei Province has resumed amid the spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).</p>
<p>
	Wearing masks, local workers and those who did not leave for home during the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday on Tuesday resumed construction of four sections of the Rongcheng-Wuhai New Expressway, which will link the existing Beijing-Hongkong-Macao line to reach Beijing.</p>
<p>
	To avoid cross-infection, the construction sites will be encircled with closed-off management, and new workers must be put under quarantine before entering the sites, according to the provincial department of transport.</p>
<p>
	The workers will also have their body temperatures checked every day.</p>
<p>
	To offset the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, the provincial government has encouraged different localities to be innovative in streamlining approval procedures to save time for developers and get construction projects started as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
	On Feb. 13, the provincial department of transport issued a notice requesting timely resuming construction of major projects related to the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei integrated development, the Xiongan New Area and the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.</p>

In the five years to follow, every year he joined the FICPI delegation to the meeting with the then State Intellectual Property Office of China. During the period 2012 to 2015, he served as President of FICPI. ""During this period, I could see how the IP system was continuously improved and that much thinking went into how to do in best in such a large country like China. I noticed during these meetings with All-China Patent Agents Association and also engaging with Chinese patent and trademark attorneys professionally is the rapid increase in quality and depth in Chinese IP firms,"" said Koster.</p>
<p>
	""Having an IP system that is developing as fast and to the magnitude of the IP system in China is obviously not easy and comes with challenges. One of the issues is to maintain the balance between output (number of filings) and quality,""said Koster. ""In view of the strong economy in China there is a huge demand for patents and trademarks. Another challenge is education for individuals and companies as to the role of IP. I believe every company should have a thorough understanding what the end goals are of having IP rights and an IP portfolio. ""</p>
<p>
	In Koster's eyes, many people have no idea about IP system in China. When he tells them that China has one of the most sophisticated IP Offices and files the most patents and trademarks in the world, it came as a surprise to them. To process the large number of patents, utility patents and trademarks annually being filed in China is no easy task. Starting with having sufficient IP attorneys, enabling IP firms, having a very strong administrative system to deal with IP applications and a strong Court system to deal with enforcement. The government of China has done an excellent job to ensure that the rapid growth in the IP system takes place at all levels. In his experience China is one of the few countries having judicial enforcement measures for IP infringement. He therefore believes that the negative comments some people hear about the IP system in China is often based on incorrect perceptions and not on facts.</p>
<p>
	""Given the success story of the IP system in China and the very short time it was obtained, I am confident that the IP system will continue to improve at its current pace. The rest of the world can be assured that their IP rights will be well protected and enforceable in China,"" according to Koster.</p>

Trump voices opposition to proposed export controls, 2020-02-19 15:08:16,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	WASHINGTON, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday voiced his opposition to proposed export-restricting measures, saying that such measures would cause U.S. companies to lose orders to other places.</p>
<p>
	""The United States cannot, &amp; will not, become such a difficult place to deal with in terms of foreign countries buying our product, including for the always used National Security excuse, that our companies will be forced to leave in order to remain competitive,"" Trump said in a series of tweets.</p>
<p>
	The U.S. president's tweets came just two days after the Wall Street Journal reported that officials within the administration were considering new restrictions on exports of jet engines co-produced by General Electric Co. to China.</p>
<p>
	""We want to sell product and goods to China and other countries. That's what trade is all about,"" Trump said. ""We don't want to make it impossible to do business with us. That will only mean that orders will go to someplace else.""</p>
<p>
	""As an example, I want China to buy our jet engines, the best in the World,"" he said.</p>
<p>
	""I have seen some of the regulations being circulated, including those being contemplated by Congress, and they are ridiculous,"" Trump said. ""I want to make it EASY to do business with the United States, not difficult.""</p>
<p>
	Trump's comment on export controls was welcomed by the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA).</p>
<p>
	""We applaud President Trump's tweets supporting U.S. companies being able to sell products to China and opposing proposed regulations that would unduly curtail that ability,"" SIA President &amp; CEO John Neuffer said in a statement.</p>
<p>
	""As we have discussed with the Administration, sales of non-sensitive, commercial products to China drive semiconductor research and innovation, which is critical to America's economic strength and national security,"" said Neuffer.</p>

[China to continue constructive role in political settlement of Ukrainian crisis envoy], 2020-02-19 15:06:20,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese envoy said Tuesday that China will continue to play a constructive role in seeking a political settlement to the Ukrainian crisis.</p>
<p>
	""China always adopts an objective and impartial position on the Ukrainian crisis, respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, Ukraine included, and opposes interference in Ukraine's internal affairs by any external forces,"" Wu Haitao, China's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, told the Security Council meeting on the situation in Ukraine.</p>
<p>
	""We maintain that there is no military solution to the crisis and that dialogue and negotiation are the only way out,"" he said, adding that China will continue to play a constructive role in the political settlement of the Ukrainian crisis.</p>
<p>
	Noting that the Minsk II agreement remains the ""greatest common denominator"" of all parties now, Wu said the agreement, endorsed by the UN Security Council, is the key to the political mediation of the Ukrainian crisis.</p>
<p>
	""China calls on relevant parties to concretely implement the agreement, remain committed to the overall direction of a political settlement and seek a comprehensive solution to the crisis through dialogue and consultation, so as to facilitate the realization of peace, stability and development in Ukraine, and promotes the harmony among all ethnicities in Ukraine and Ukraine's peaceful coexistence with regional countries,"" said the diplomat.</p>
<p>
	The Minsk II agreement refers to a package of measures signed in early 2015 between Kiev and regional armed groups, a renewal of a truce deal reached in September 2014.</p>
<p>
	The agreement came into being after leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany reached consensus on measures to peacefully end the conflict in Donbas in eastern Ukraine, which erupted in April 2014.</p>

        <p>
	The coronavirus epidemic has made things worse for the Chinese tourism industry, which was already in a slump from the post-Spring Festival off-season, with some small and medium-sized enterprises caught in a capital shortage crisis and finding themselves close to bankruptcy. However, some companies have made the most of the time to strengthen staff training and collaborate with other businesses to make money.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0219/FOREIGN202002191504000049337668253.jpg"" style=""width: 550px; height: 567px;""></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<em>Ctrip offers online training courses for employees. (Photo/People's Daily Online)</em></p>
<p>
	""The epidemic will not end just because we worry about it,” said Mr. Jin, a store manager of Ctrip, a business and travel management company, in central China’s Wuhan city, in comments that have been echoed by many tourism professionals.</p>
<p>
	At present, the direct and indirect employment from tourism in China has reached 79.9 million, and the total number of travel agencies in China has topped 38,000. In anticipation of a business shutdown, many tourism enterprises have focused on improving their professional skills, so as to prepare for the future.</p>
<p>
	Ctrip has recently announced that it will open nearly 2,000 training courses to its partners and tens of millions of employees across the industry, calling on the travel industry to ""have training online and at home, conserve energy and reserve talents"".</p>
<p>
	""Many of the courses are taught by leading experts from the front line of business,"" according to Xu Zhiyun, dean of Ctrip's college of tourism. The number of active APP users at the online college has increased by 150 percent to nearly 30,000 in just a few days since the course opened on February 5, with an average daily online time of 77 minutes.</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile, the cooperation between Fresh Hema, a fresh grocery chain store in China, and many catering enterprises has resulted in new jobs for many catering workers.</p>
<p>
	""What we need most is manpower, so we joined with Xibei and other restaurant enterprises to let idle restaurant staff join our store. We will give them the relevant training and then ask them to do some work sorting goods,"" Ma Chunmao, a person in charge at Fresh Hema, said.</p>
<p>
	Over 1,200 people from more than 20 catering enterprises have joined Fresh Hema’s temporary employment team.</p>
<p>
	The same is true of the travel industry. With hotels closed and the travel agency business shut down, tens of thousands of tourism personnel cannot engage in normal work. A few travel enterprises have also begun to collaborate with Fresh Hema.</p>
<p>
	Mr. Zhang, a former travel sales consultant on LY.com, a travel booking platform, has switched to selling daily supplies such as face masks and disinfectants.</p>
<p>
	This is part of his job at a community group buying platform incubated by LY.com. After the outbreak, the company mobilized up to 300 employees to join the project. At the same time, Caissa Tourism, a travel service company, also said that it is actively trying to get into the retail business to become more diversified, and more in line with user needs.</p>
<p>
	""We spent a whole day training our colleagues, turning salesmen of travel products into salesmen of masks, disinfectants and chemical products, and achieved a sales volume of 10 million yuan on the same day,"" a person in charge at the company revealed.</p>
<p>
	Ctrip said its 8,000 branded travel stores have come under pressure during the outbreak. A ""care plan"" has been launched for stores, including the suspension of management fees for three months, and the deadlines of tasks assigned for each store has been extended by three months to relieve operating pressure.</p>
<p>
	Faced with the current financial pressure, tourism industry insiders pointed out that mutual assistance and sharing will become the norm in the current tourism industry, and enterprises should stick together in times of difficulty. </p>

	<em>China held a launch ceremony for its first Type 075 amphibious assault ship in Shanghai on September 25, 2019. </em></p>
<p>
	Chinese arms enterprises have been racing to keep up with their production schedule after resuming work following an extended Spring Festival holiday due to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak with a key amphibious assault ship maker scrambling to outfit an ""important"" ship and aviation companies running test flights for newly built warplanes.</p>
<p>
	Shaanxi Aircraft Industry (Group) Corporation Ltd under the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) was the first to send a new aircraft into the sky after resuming work on February 10, a little more than a week later than the original plan, cannews.com, an aviation news website run by AVIC, reported on Monday.</p>
<p>
	With the support of the Chinese Air Force, the company successfully conducted a test flight for a newly built KJ-500 early warning aircraft, according to the report.</p>
<p>
	Hongdu Aviation Industry Group, another subsidiary of AVIC, conducted a test flight for a new L-15 advanced training and light combat jet on Monday, according to a statement the company released on its WeChat public account on Monday.</p>
<p>
	Other AVIC subsidiaries, including fighter jet makers Chengdu Aircraft Industrial (Group) Co Ltd and Shenyang Aircraft Company Limited, have also resumed operation, cannews.com said.</p>
<p>
	Shipyards, including the Dalian Shipyard and Jiangnan Shipyard, which are known for their construction of aircraft carriers and destroyers, also resumed work on February 10 with extra attention being paid to epidemic control measures, according to statements the companies released recently.</p>
<p>
	Hudong Zhonghua Shipbuilding (Group) Co Ltd, which is making the Type 075 amphibious assault ship, has also resumed operation, as it used reserve manpower to replace workers who could not make it back to work in time due to the epidemic, in a bid to keep to the original schedule for an important ship that is undergoing outfitting work, the company said in a Friday statement.</p>
<p>
	An industry insider, who only spoke on the condition of anonymity, told the Global Times on Monday that some state-owned enterprises have devised a six-day working scheme to make up for delays in the progress of key projects.</p>
<p>
	Military experts told the Global Times previously that while the virus may have an impact on China's weapons and equipment programs, it will be short-term, as the outbreak is expected to only last for a few months at worst.</p>
<p>
	Prioritizing the health and safety of people is absolutely the right course to avoid fatalities and to mitigate any long-term impact, experts said.</p>

[ Mask hotline in Shanghai assists local foreigners amid epidemic], 2020-02-19 15:04:41,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	SHANGHAI, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- Instead of queuing outside pharmacies or joining in the shopping frenzy online, foreigners in Shanghai scrambling to buy masks to fight coronavirus could make orders in a more convenient way -- dialing a ""mask hotline.""</p>
<p>
	By calling the Shanghai Call Center at 962-288, a hotline dedicated to providing information for foreigners in Shanghai with a history of over 10 years, foreigners can make inquiries about masks, current coronavirus containment efforts and other information concerning the epidemic.</p>
<p>
	Statistics showed around 100,000 foreigners stayed in Shanghai despite the coronavirus outbreak, with no cases of the novel coronavirus among them reported so far.</p>
<p>
	During the Spring Festival holiday, the hotline received thousands of inquiries, most of which were about buying masks.</p>
<p>
	""When communicating with foreigners, it is very important to speak accurately,"" said Sarah Leanne Sharman, a British who has worked in Shanghai for five years.</p>
<p>
	As Sharman can speak both English and Chinese, she is responsible for helping call center agents when they have difficulties in English language communication and understanding. The 36-year-old has been busy explaining to her Chinese colleagues the proper nouns about coronavirus used by the World Health Organization in the past few days.</p>
<p>
	Apart from 24-hour English services, the hotline also provides services in French, Japanese, German, Russian, Spanish and Arabic. Agents receiving calls will teach foreigners how to make appointments for buying masks at home and how to prepare for materials required for the appointments.</p>
<p>
	It has been a tough job for a cosmopolitan city like Shanghai to take virus containment measures such as providing citizens with enough masks, considering its population of 24 million.</p>
<p>
	Local government, enterprises and residents have made great efforts to increase the capacity of mask production.</p>
<p>
	Shanghai government encouraged local mask factories to resume operations and expand capacity, offering financial support such as rent reduction and tax incentives for enterprises that have contributed to the fight against the epidemic.</p>
<p>
	Some Shanghai citizens volunteered to work night shifts for mask factories while enterprises of other industries, including soybean product manufacturers and repurposed workshops, have added new mask production lines.</p>
<p>
	But instead of scrambling to buy masks and watching TV flooded with coronavirus-related news, what people affected by the epidemic really want is for the fight against the coronavirus to see a turnaround, life to return to normal and to finally enjoy a deep breath outdoors without masks.</p>
<p>
	China's daily new confirmed cases of novel coronavirus infection outside Hubei, the epicenter province of the outbreak, have dropped for 14 consecutive days, but experts remained cautious, calling for continuing efforts on strengthening coronavirus research and containment.</p>
<p>
	Like many foreigners in Shanghai, Sharman's life was also disrupted by the epidemic. She now works one in every three days and cooks for herself as most places nearby are closed. Because of the epidemic, she also has not been able to walk her dog as much as before.</p>
<p>
	""For me, the first thing I will do after the epidemic is to go out for dinner and take my dog to the park,"" said Sharman.</p>

China grants posthumous honor to female role models battling epidemic, 2020-02-19 14:41:31,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- The All-China Women's Federation made a decision published Tuesday to honor a doctor and two local officials who fought on the frontline of the battle against the novel coronavirus epidemic as national-level female role models.</p>
<p>
	The honor was awarded posthumously to Xu Hui, Huang Heyan and Jiang Na, according to a statement from the federation.</p>
<p>
	Xu Hui was the deputy head of the Nanjing Hospital of Chinese Medicine and a leading doctor of the hospital's special team on prevention and treatment of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak.</p>
<p>
	After 18 days of devoted and continuous work on the frontline against the epidemic, Xu died of a sudden illness on Feb. 7, said the statement.</p>
<p>
	Huang Heyan was a local official in the town of Yunwu in southwest China's Guizhou Province. During the epidemic, Huang visited the villagers for health checkups and carried out publicity on epidemic prevention and control.</p>
<p>
	""Her dedicated work has protected the health of her fellow villagers, but unfortunately Huang died of a sudden illness on Feb. 2,"" said the federation.</p>
<p>
	Jiang Na was the deputy secretary of the Party committee and chairwoman of the Women's Federation in the town of Qianqihao in northeast China's Jilin Province and had been working at grassroots communities for 19 years.</p>
<p>
	Jiang worked on information collection and epidemic knowledge publicity in the town. She died on Feb. 4 in a car accident during her trip to check on the epidemic prevention and control work and distribute drugs.</p>
<p>
	Xu, Huang and Jiang are three representatives of the countless outstanding women fighting in the frontline of epidemic prevention and control, said the federation.</p>
<p>
	The federation called on women across China to learn from the three comrades with their firm faith, lofty spirit and great character.</p>

International society calls for strengthened solidarity in fight against novel coronavirus epidemic, 2020-02-19 14:39:24,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	International organizations, governments of various countries, experts, scholars, and media are calling for scientific approaches, rationality, and cooperation to cope with the current public health challenge facing mankind.</p>
<p>
	Highlighting the huge challenge the coronavirus outbreak is posing, United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said recently that China has made a ""very strong and very impressive response."" The huge efforts made by the country will curb the spread of the virus, he added.</p>
<p>
	Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia, or COVID-19, China has strengthened communication with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the international society in an open, transparent, and responsible manner.</p>
<p>
	It has saved valuable time for global epidemic prevention, built a line of defense to control the spread of the epidemic, and set a new benchmark for global epidemic prevention.</p>
<p>
	Recently, representatives of the WHO and American technology companies held a special meeting on how to prevent the spread of misinformation about the epidemic on the internet.</p>
<p>
	WHO representative Andy Pattinson described the fake information surrounding the novel coronavirus outbreak as an “information epidemic”. At the meeting, the WHO and U.S. technology enterprises reached an agreement on issues regarding the epidemic, with the latter pledging to take measures to guide information searching, promoting reliable information sources and purifying the public opinion environment for epidemic prevention and control.</p>
<p>
	“While the virus spreads, misinformation makes the job of our heroic health workers even harder. It is diverting the attention of decision makers. And it causes confusion and spreads fear to the general public. At WHO, we’re not just battling the virus; we’re also battling the trolls and conspiracy theorists that push misinformation and undermine the outbreak response,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.</p>
<p>
	The European Union (EU) appreciates China’s epidemic prevention and control measures, European Commissioner for Equality Helena Dalli said on a recent plenary session of the European Parliament held in Strasbourg, France, during which discussion on the COVID-19 was carried out.</p>
<p>
	Fighting the epidemic is not a task for China alone, as the epidemic is a challenge facing the whole world. The EU should strengthen cooperation with China and take its global responsibility, Dalli said, adding discrimination against Asians or persons perceived as Asians or any other race or ethnicity is contrary to EU law and the organization will not tolerate any racial discrimination.</p>
<p>
	Most of the Members of European Parliament (MEP) believe that no country could address the challenge of the epidemic alone.</p>
<p>
	The EU should promote information sharing among its member states and share information with China in order to eliminate social panic caused by fake information, they said, believing that the recent cases of discrimination in some countries are inhumane and run counter to the basic values of the EU, and every effort should be made to stop discrimination.</p>
<p>
	Rumors always frighten the public who lack relevant knowledge amid epidemic. Therefore, media and medical experts in many countries are actively spreading knowledge about the epidemic through various channels to break down rumors and help them establish correct understanding.</p>
<p>
	In The Daily Show with Trevor Noah, Chinese Malaysian comedian and actor Ronny Chieng staged a talk show to break down the misinformation and racism surrounding the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>
	He humorously refuted the claim that drinking bleach, eating garlic, and rinsing nose with saline help prevent the virus, and asked people to stop calling the virus an Asian virus and stereotyping Asian people. The show received a warm response from the audience after it was aired.</p>
<p>
	Facing the threat of unknown viruses, people often feel anxious and helpless, and the demand for information has risen sharply. This has created a market for various rumors and conspiracy theories, according to Dr. Cheng Huang, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Global Health at George Washington University.</p>
<p>
	In addition to objectively and comprehensively presenting evidence and clarifying facts, authorities also need to reveal why such ridiculous remarks are made, he pointed out.</p>
<p>
	“This is a time for facts, not fear. This is a time for rationality, not rumors. This is a time for solidarity, not stigma,” Tedros has repeatedly stressed.</p>
<p>
	The Chinese government has always maintained close cooperation with the WHO in the fight against the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, said Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Program, at a regular media briefing on Feb. 14. The global response to the outbreak should be based on facts rather than speculations, he noted.</p>
<p>
	At a recent press conference, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova condemned some Western media for using false information to vilify China.</p>
<p>
	At a time when the Chinese people are facing the unprecedented novel coronavirus pneumonia, writers of many reports were using disinformation and fraudulent facts, and were showing a lack of respect and sympathy, she said.</p>

[US blacklists Russian entity to further pressure Maduro government], 2020-02-19 14:40:07,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	WASHINGTON, Feb. 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. government announced on Tuesday that it had imposed sanctions against a subsidiary of Russian oil producer Rosneft and the subsidiary's president due to their alleged support for Venezuela in sanctions evasion, the latest move to further squeeze the Venezuelan government.</p>
<p>
	The designated targets were Rosneft Trading S.A., a subsidiary of the Russian state-controlled Rosneft oil company, and its president Didier Casimiro, according to a statement issued by U.S. Department of the Treasury.</p>
<p>
	""Rosneft Trading S.A. and its president brokered the sale and transport of Venezuelan crude oil,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in the statement.</p>
<p>
	The statement noted that all property and interests of the blacklisted targets are blocked. Meanwhile, the Treasury also issued a general license that allows companies to wind down their transactions with Rosneft Trading S.A.</p>
<p>
	A senior official of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration said during a background press call that Rosneft Trading S.A. has provided ""the overwhelming amount of financial resources and hard currency"" for the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.</p>
<p>
	The senior official pointed out that the United States was ""somewhere in 50 to 60 percent of our maximum pressure strategy and campaign towards Venezuela,"" saying that it would continue to implement pressure against Venezuela until ""there is a democratic transition.""</p>
<p>
	""The president has made clear over and over again that all options are on the table, we will continue to analyze all options,"" the official added.</p>
<p>
	In response to U.S. blacklisting Rosneft Trading S.A., Venezuelan Foreign Affairs Minister Jorge Arreaza later in the day said that the United States aims to aggravate the misery of Venezuelan people.</p>
<p>
	""The U.S. coercive, unilateral measures against Rosneft Trading are aimed against our oil industry, its workers and the Venezuelan economy,"" Arreaza said on Twitter.</p>
<p>
	""They continue to attack the Venezuelan people, trying to incite suffering and hardship,"" he added.</p>
<p>
	Tuesday's sanction came less than two weeks after the United States blocked a state-owned Venezuelan airline amid increasing wrestling between Washington and Moscow over the Venezuela issue.</p>
<p>
	The United States has been pursuing a policy of economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation against the Maduro government in support of Venezuela's opposition leader Juan Guaido.</p>
<p>
	Following the reception held by Trump for Guaido at the White House earlier this month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov paid an official visit to Venezuela to enhance bilateral cooperation.</p>
<p>
	""We have agreed on our path of future work, to deepen economic cooperation of investments in other areas, despite illegitimate sanctions,"" Lavrov said after meeting with Maduro on Feb. 7.</p>
<p>
	The priority sectors for investment are energy, natural resources, industry, and agriculture, Lavrov said in Venezuela, adding that great importance would also be placed on developing military cooperation.</p>
<p>
	""Russians may soon find that their continued support of Maduro will no longer be cost-free,"" U.S. Special Representative for Venezuela Elliott Abrams said in early February.</p>

[To cope with global challenges with multilateralism cooperation], 2020-02-19 14:37:30,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	The sudden outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia is a reminder for the world that we are living in a time when traditional security intertwines with non-traditional security and when regional and global issues interconvert. The human beings are seeing increasing interdependence and their destinies are gradually becoming one.</p>
<p>
	The Munich Security Conference held from Feb. 14 to 16 also indicated such point as the meeting paid close attention to global public health security and the novel coronavirus epidemic.</p>
<p>
	At the conference, China introduced its concerted efforts and achievements in combating the epidemic, and received wide praise from the attendants. World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also recognized the encouraging steps China has taken to contain the outbreak at its source, and once again called for solidarity from the international society.</p>
<p>
	In this silent “war” where no bullet is used, the entire world has become a whole and a community with a shared future.</p>
<p>
	China’s most comprehensive, strict and thorough measures to combat the epidemic represent the largest contribution to global epidemic prevention and control. Thanks to the country’s speed and efficiency which play a vital role in the battle against the virus, and its active engagement in global cooperation, the confirmed cases outside the country only account for less than 1 percent of the total.</p>
<p>
	“I have given credit where it’s due, and I will continue to do that.” Tedros’ remarks echo the common aspiration of the international society, as China, which is combating the virus on the frontline, totally deserves such compliments.</p>
<p>
	By supporting China, global countries are supporting their own and the epidemic prevention and control of the world.</p>
<p>
	China is not lonely, because people across the world are standing closely with the Chinese people in the hardest days of the battle. Leaders from more than 160 countries and international organizations sent messages of sympathy to China to express strong support for the country, and people from many countries also took active actions to donate money and materials to encourage China.</p>
<p>
	An Indonesian policeman recently sang the song ""Jiayou, Wuhan"" (Stay strong, Wuhan) on social media to show love; children from a primary school in Northern Ireland joined together to perform a Chinese song, Let the World be Full of Love, for people in China suffering from the coronavirus outbreak; and Sri Lankans prayed for China's victory against the novel coronavirus epidemic. To show the power of solidarity in the epidemic is the choice made by the people across the world.</p>
<p>
	A profound lesson has been taught by the epidemic to the world. At the Munich Security Conference, the debate over ""Westlessness,"" which refers to the loss of common standing of what it means to be part of the West, reflected insufficient sense of security.</p>
<p>
	The world should figure out what security is and how it can be achieved. Common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustained security is what the world needs, as no country in this planet is able to avoid global challenges or deal with them alone.</p>
<p>
	Countries must stop dividing the world into the east and the west, fill the economic gap between the north and the south, take the planet on which human beings rely as a community with shared lives, and perceive the international society as a family, so as to build a community with a shared future for mankind.</p>
<p>
	Only by joining hands and working together can the world overcome the global public health challenge. It is a moment that demonstrates the power of multilateralism and international cooperation. The Group of 77 and the United Nations voiced support for China’s efforts to combat the epidemic, followed by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the BRICS countries, ASEAN and the African Union.</p>
<p>
	Fifteen members of the Economic Community of West African States convened an emergency meeting of health ministers to coordinate efforts and cope with the novel coronavirus outbreak. A special China-ASEAN foreign ministers' meeting on the novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak will also be held in Laos, which marks another important meeting between China and ASEAN on public health cooperation after the special leaders meeting on the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak they held in 2003.</p>
<p>
	Building multilateralism to jointly protect the health and security of people around the world has become a choice for more and more countries and regions.</p>
<p>
	In the era of globalization, countries are sharing challenges, responsibilities and destiny. To practice multilateralism and cope with global challenges with cooperation conforms to the general trend of time and the common aspiration of the people.</p>

[Xinjiang ensures normal operation of ChinaEurope freight trains], 2020-02-19 14:39:49,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	URUMQI, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- The customs and railway departments in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have simplified customs clearance procedures to ensure the normal operation of China-Europe trains amid the novel coronavirus epidemic prevention and control.</p>
<p>
	A China-Europe freight train passed through the Horgos Port heading for Poland Monday afternoon, marking the 61st China-Europe freight train leaving China via the port in February this year.</p>
<p>
	On Saturday, a China-Europe train carrying 850 tonnes of raw cotton entered China via the Alataw Pass in the region.</p>
<p>
	Due to the impact of the novel coronavirus, most of the China-Europe freight trains carrying imports have been suspended or delayed, and the number of the exit and entry trains has dropped sharply since late January.</p>
<p>
	Dou Luxin, deputy director of the Horgos customs, said the customs sent officers to check all the trains so as to prevent the epidemic from spreading through the port.</p>
<p>
	Since the beginning of the year, the Horgos Port and the Alataw Pass have seen more than 730 China-Europe freight trains entering and leaving China. The export goods mainly included mechanical and electrical products, clothing, and electronic products while the imports are mainly cotton yarn and construction materials.</p>

	WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. private space company SpaceX launched its fifth batch of 60 Starlink satellites into space on Monday, in an effort to build at minimum a 12,000-strong satellite network capable of providing broadband internet services.</p>
<p>
	The Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the satellites, lifted off at 10:05 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (1505 GMT) from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force, Florida, according to a live broadcast by SpaceX.</p>
<p>
	SpaceX designed Starlink to provide continual internet coverage around the world, using a network of satellites in low-Earth orbit.</p>
<p>
	Falcon 9's reusable first stage missed a landing on SpaceX's drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean. It didn't appear as scheduled upon the drone ship about nine minutes after the liftoff, according to the live broadcast.</p>
<p>
	This first stage previously launched two supply missions for the International Space Station in May and July of 2019, and the JCSAT-18/Kacific1 mission in December of 2019.</p>
<p>
	About 15 minutes after the liftoff, the satellites were deployed. They will be moved into their intended orbits and operational altitude of 550 km after checks take place, according to SpaceX.</p>
<p>
	SpaceX plans to launch into space about 12,000 Starlink satellites by 2024, and has revealed a bigger plan to launch 30,000 additional ones, bringing the total to 42,000.</p>
<p>
	Each Starlink satellite weights approximately 260 kg and features a compact, flat-panel design that minimizes volume, allowing for a dense launch stack to take full advantage of Falcon 9's launch capabilities, according to SpaceX.</p>
<p>
	The company's internet service will be available in the northern United States and Canada at some point this year, with global coverage planned for 2021.</p>

[Chinas antiepidemic fight can lend many lessons to international community for combating pandemics], 2020-02-19 14:45:43,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	China's ongoing people's war against COVID19 epidemic can lend many lessons and inspirations to the international community for combating pandemics in the future, experts from a Shanghai-based think tank said in a report published Friday.</p>
<p>
	“Although the COVID-19 epidemic continues, China is well-positioned to win the ultimate victory against it,” the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies said in an update on China's fight against the novel coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>
	The think tank summarized three key lessons this monumental event offers China and the world regarding international cooperation on global public health emergencies.</p>
<p>
	First, a globalized world featuring more densely-populated metropolitan areas with higher population mobility poses unique challenges for epidemic prevention and control. Although mega-cities have generally established full-fledged public health emergency response mechanisms, yet economic, political, social, and security concerns all magnify decision-makers' and the public's sensitivity to the outbreak of infectious diseases. Therefore, emergency response mechanisms, social mobilization systems, and reserve systems for strategic assets must be institutionalized in mega-cities. Besides, the competence of community-level officials and individuals’ public health awareness need to be improved through more training courses and mass education programs.</p>
<p>
	Second, China's cross-region medical supply systems and coordinating networks for medical experts are playing a decisive role in the current war against COVID-19 epidemic. Rallying more than 10,000 medical professionals and coordinating huge amounts of medical materials to reinforce Wuhan's public health systems at short notice is not only a result of the full functioning of the central and local governments, but also thanks to efficient logistics and professional/resource allocation. For sure, China can share its challenges and good practices with the international community.</p>
<p>
	Last but not least, international cooperation proves increasingly important in the war against COVID-19 epidemic. In partnership with China, the WHO has been closely monitoring the epidemic and coordinating a concerted international response. National governments across the world have also extended a helping hand. As of February 7, more than 30 countries, including developing countries with medical supply shortages like Pakistan and Myanmar, have donated medical materials to China. Such acts of international humanitarianism indicate that in times of global emergency, international solidarity and coordination, rather than extreme rhetoric and excessive reaction, is what is needed for the well-being of the international community. For, as the Chinese saying goes, “Saving him to whom you’re tied from the river is saving yourself.”</p>

Chinese communities in South Korea reach out hand to help fight novel coronavirus outbreak, 2020-02-19 13:27:26,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	SEOUL, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- ""Fighting, Wuhan!"" ""Fighting, China!"" Such encouraging words were written on the cardboard boxes of masks piled up in the logistic warehouse of China's Yunda Express in South Korea.</p>
<p>
	These boxes will soon be delivered to the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) outbreak, to help combat the epidemic. The masks were all donated from Chinese nationals residing in South Korea.</p>
<p>
	Since the very beginning when the COVID-19 broke out in Wuhan, Chinese residing all over South Korea have actively joined efforts to provide as much help as possible in China's battle against the deadly epidemic.</p>
<p>
	""Although we are living overseas, our hearts are deeply connected to our motherland,"" said Nian Chen, president of the All-Korea Association of Chinese Students and Scholars.</p>
<p>
	""Our association, including more than 100 branches in universities in South Korea, started fund-raising on Jan. 26, and in less than 10 hours on the first day alone, there were over 26,000 students and teachers taking part and contributing their donations,"" Nian said.</p>
<p>
	Of these donations many came from overseas students who have no source of income themselves and their donations did not come on a massive scale.</p>
<p>
	""But we believe that more hands produce a stronger flame, and we have already collected more than 530,000 yuan (about 75,745 U.S. dollars),"" he said.</p>
<p>
	Aside from collecting funds for charity projects to help medical staff working at the front line, a lot of Chinese nationals are focusing on addressing the urgent need in hospitals in China for surgical masks, goggles and protective gears.</p>
<p>
	Sun Sheng, president of the All-Korea Chinese Workers' Federation, said that he contacted several local mask manufacturers ahead of the 4-day Lunar New Year holiday in South Korea, which can produce 1 million masks a week. The producers agreed to offer masks at the original price to China.</p>
<p>
	""As an overseas Chinese, we wish to do whatever we can to provide some bit of help,"" said Sun.</p>
<p>
	Cao Qiang was an employee working at the Incheon warehouse of Yunda Express in South Korea. His major responsibility was to assist in delivering badly-needed medical goods to China as fast as possible.</p>
<p>
	""We cut our Spring Festival holiday and went back to work early to help with delivery of masks and protective suits,"" Cao said. ""We now usually work till 11 or 12 o'clock at night, but everyone is so high-spirited and passionate about what we are doing.""</p>
<p>
	""And we are doing the best we can to deliver faster, because we know there was a severe lack of medical materials domestically, in particular in Wuhan,"" he said.</p>
<p>
	Several Chinese delivery companies have opened up green channels for the donated materials.</p>
<p>
	Liang Zhongjin, executive director of Yunda Express South Korean branch, said that they have already cleared 5,000 square meters' space in the warehouse in South Korea for storage of donations.</p>
<p>
	Most of the donations were masks, he noted. He also contacted in advance airlines and customs to make sure such relief supplies can reach Hubei Province, the most heavily hit province of China, at an earliest date possible free of charge.</p>
<p>
	So far, Chinese nationals living in South Korea have donated in total more than 800,000 yuan (about 114,331 dollars) and about 320,000 masks and 2,000 protective suits directly to the severely affected areas in China, according to figures released by the Chinese Embassy in South Korea.</p>
<p>
	""If we send the medical materials back one day earlier, then perhaps there will be one less infection and more patients being saved,"" Cao said. ""Although I can't work at the front line in domestic hospitals, I hope I can contribute all my share.""</p>

Palestinian handicapped artist makes sand carving to show solidarity with China, 2020-02-19 14:02:49,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	GAZA, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- Mohammad Toutah, a 34-year-old Palestinian amputee, is holding the handle of a margin trowel to carve some letters with sands on the beach of Gaza City, trying to express solidarity in his own way with the Chinese people fighting the novel coronavirus epidemic.</p>
<p>
	After a while of careful work, a piece of sand sculpture, in the form of two short lines of letters reads in Arabic ""Palestine in Solidarity with China,"" was finished.</p>
<p>
	Toutah, father of four children, lost his right leg during an attack on the Gaza Strip in 2009.</p>
<p>
	""The only way to express my solidarity with our Chinese brothers is to carve on sands to send them my message of solidarity,"" said the Palestinian artist, standing beside the sculpture with the help of a pair of crutches.</p>
<p>
	China is undergoing some difficulties and the Palestinian people are following the situation in China with deep concerns, he said, in a reference to the pneumonia epidemic caused by the novel coronavirus, officially dubbed COVID-19, in China at the beginning of this year. He called on all others to support and pray for the Asian country.</p>
<p>
	By the end of Tuesday, the disease has infected 74,185 people on the Chinese mainland, and 2,004 people had died of the epidemic. Meanwhile, a total of 14,376 people had been discharged from hospital after recovery.</p>
<p>
	Since the outbreak of the disease, many countries and organizations have extended a helping hand to China and showed their firm solidarity through different channels.</p>
<p>
	Toutah said despite the hard living situation in the region, he decided to come here to make the sand sculpture to show his support for China in an artistic way.</p>
<p>
	Carving and drawing on the sands was part of the activities of the youth's campaign to express solidarity with China. The campaign is run by prominent journalists and veteran social media activists.</p>
<p>
	They also launched activities in cooperation with Gaza children and called on people to show their solidarity on the Internet.</p>
<p>
	When making the sculpture, Toutah drew attentions from people around and passer-bys, who chose to take photos and videos with him and his work.</p>
<p>
	""This man is reflecting the real image of the Palestinian people that despite their internal crisis, they never forget to send message to the world that they are with humanity,"" said Al-Hamadani in his mid-20s, who did not give his full name. ""China is a great country and I'm confident that it will win this battle and get rid of the coronavirus,"" he added.</p>
<p>
	Allah al-Hajj, standing with her three friends on the beach, said she feels sad for what is happening in China, as ""the epidemic has no mercy"" and does not know any races or genders.</p>
<p>
	Palestinians are eager to hear very soon that China managed to overcome the issue and succeeded in fighting the epidemic, she said.</p>
<p>
	After completing his work, Toutah walked to a little hill of sands to watch how the carving looked like, and then he implanted a Palestinian flag in the middle of the sand.</p>

[Heres what US has contributed to global efforts amid epidemic], 2020-02-19 13:28:15,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	The public health emergency of the novel coronavirus pneumonia exactly exposed the unhealthy mentality of certain country in handling international relations and cooperation.</p>
<p>
	The U.S. government was recently reported to have delayed a foreign aid fund it promised and announced to reduce financial support to the World Health Organization (WHO) when the world is at a critical moment in the combat against the epidemic.</p>
<p>
	Such practice further explained the role of the U.S. in international relations.</p>
<p>
	U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced recently on social media that Washington would offer up to $100 million to China and other countries affected by the coronavirus to combat its spread, saying ""This commitment demonstrates strong U.S. leadership in response to the outbreak.”</p>
<p>
	However, when asked about the implementation of the fund at a news conference held on Feb.10 in Washington, James Richardson, director of the Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance Resources at the State Department, said the $100 million was just an upper limit.</p>
<p>
	Except for some assigned projects to help Laos, he didn’t disclose further details about the fund.</p>
<p>
	Any constructive international cooperation shall be welcomed in this global public health challenge, including the assistance promised by the U.S. for Southeast Asian countries such as Laos.</p>
<p>
	However, people would question that the implementation of the assistance obviously doesn’t match what Washington has promised. What’s more, the delayed aid is also not convincing enough to back the “strong leadership” claimed by the U.S. government.</p>
<p>
	From announcing a high-profile aid plan to being vague about concrete action, what on earth is the intention of the U.S. govement?</p>
<p>
	When this question is still confusing the world, it is followed by a 2021 budget proposal that says the White House seeks to halve U.S. funding for the WHO which is leading the fight against the coronavirus outbreak at this critical moment.</p>
<p>
	Washington explained that to offer direct aid funding to designated countries is a better way to deal with public health emergencies. However, this explanation further confused the world – if the U.S. believes direct aid is more effective, then what is it doing to make its promised $100-million aid effective?</p>
<p>
	What it has done is clear. The country was the first to announce a travel ban against China, which clearly violated the WHO's recommendation. Some U.S. politicians even took the lead in spreading conspiracy theories and used the epidemic to discredit China.</p>
<p>
	Such dark mentality and dangerous practices go against not only the U.S. claim of “strong leadership”, but also the bottom line of human civilization.</p>
<p>
	It’s interesting that when most American health experts and citizens hope to work with the world to defeat the epidemic, Washington is politicalizing the matter and running counter to the voice of the masses.</p>
<p>
	In recent years, America, the leading country in the world, has shown decreasing enthusiasm for international cooperation and reduced support for global multilateral systems, which is the biggest concern of the international society over the country’s diplomacy. The arbitrary practices of the U.S. are constantly worsening the negative impacts on global governance, which is further indicated by the remarks and practices of the U.S. amid the current epidemic.</p>
<p>
	Countries are interconnected in today’s world where one who tries to blow out other’s oil lamp will get his beard on fire. As a result, to strengthen cooperation remains the only right choice to cope with challenges.</p>

        <p>
	The unexpected novel coronavirus epidemic may have taken a toll on China’s tourism industry, but the sector will rebound thanks to its resilience and the country’s bailout plans.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0219/FOREIGN202002191353000282035246842.jpg"" style=""width: 400px; height: 247px;""></p>
<p>
	<em>112 tourists from central China’s Hubei province stranded in Sanya, south China’s Hainan province, returned to Hubei by chartered plane following the novel coronavirus outbreak on Feb. 13.</em></p>
<p>
	The relevant departments, including the Ministry of Culture and Tourism (MCT), have rolled out corresponding measures to help the tourism industry get through its current difficulties.</p>
<p>
	The ministry will refund 80 percent of the service quality deposits that travel agencies put up when opening for business, the MCT said in a statement on Feb. 6, adding that the agencies can deposit the money again within the next two years.</p>
<p>
	Local governments have also launched bailout plans for the sector. Southwest China’s Sichuan province announced 10 measures to help travel agencies resume operation while still curbing the epidemic, while east China’s Shandong province issued a notice to speed up work resumption of State-level A-class scenic spots.</p>
<p>
	Dai Bin, head of the China Tourism Academy, said that the sector will see better development due to supporting policies and huge market potential.</p>
<p>
	In the first three quarters of 2019, domestic journeys and tourism revenue surged 8.9 percent and 13 percent year on year, respectively, Dai said. What was of special note was that rural residents’ travel spending soared by 22.3 percent in the third quarter last year, Dai added.</p>
<p>
	Citizens’ tourism consumption potential has been further unleashed in recent years thanks to steady and solid progress in measures such as the reduction of ticket prices of state-owned major scenic spots and the launching of pilot national park programs, he noted.</p>
<p>
	Dai also said that huge consumption potential is promoting in-depth development of mass tourism in the country, and supporting sustainable development of the sector, as people have inelastic demands for tourism.</p>
<p>

[Rumor Buster Does China show lack of transparency on coronavirus epidemic], 2020-02-19 14:28:26,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- Some Western media and White House officials have recently made unnecessary and groundless claims saying that China has shown a ""lack of transparency"" in dealing with information related to the novel coronavirus epidemic.</p>
<p>
	These allegations are obviously not grounded in facts. The Chinese authorities have taken visible and transparent measures to respond to public concerns and work closely with the international community to fight the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).</p>
<p>
	First, China, in a timely manner, shared the information of the virus' genetic sequence and other relevant information with the world, a significant step for other countries and international organizations to carry out immediate research for the development of treatments.</p>
<p>
	Second, both the central and local-level governments hold daily news conferences, updating the numbers of new confirmed cases, deaths, patients in severe condition and recoveries in detail, and introducing the current situation and latest developments regarding the epidemic's prevention and treatment in China.</p>
<p>
	Third, Chinese researchers have published a series of academic papers on their early findings of the novel coronavirus in medical journals such as the Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine, sharing the results of their research with the world.</p>
<p>
	Last but not least, China has repeatedly made it clear that it welcomes efforts and support from around the world and is ready to cooperate closely with foreign governments, experts, companies and organizations to jointly combat the illness.</p>
<p>
	At the moment, a WHO team of international experts are in China and working with their Chinese counterparts to find more methods to better treat and prevent a further spread of the epidemic.</p>
<p>
	Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, has highly praised the ""speed with which China detected the outbreak, isolated the virus, sequenced the genome and shared it with the WHO and the world.""</p>
<p>
	""So is China's commitment to transparency and to supporting other countries. In many ways, China is actually setting a new standard for outbreak response,"" he added.</p>

[Chinas top political advisor stresses overcoming COVID19 impact on poverty relief], 2020-02-19 14:29:40,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- China's top political advisor Wang Yang said the novel coronavirus epidemic is the biggest factor affecting this year's poverty relief work, and demanded resolute efforts to overcome such impact.</p>
<p>
	Wang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, made the remarks Tuesday at a symposium with leaders of non-Communist parties on supervising poverty relief.</p>
<p>
	""The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 brings challenges to the battle against poverty,"" Wang said, calling for efforts from non-Communist parties to analyze the impact of the epidemic on the realization of poverty alleviation goals in deep poverty-stricken areas and carry out democratic oversight to make sure local authorities direct funds and policies to severely impoverished areas, as well as areas and populations severely affected by the epidemic.</p>
<p>
	Wang also called on non-Communist parties to conduct in-depth research on major issues on poverty alleviation and to put forward high-quality policy suggestions to the CPC Central Committee.</p>
<p>
	China is aiming to lift all rural residents living below the current poverty line out of poverty and eliminate poverty in all poor counties and regions by 2020. Wang called for efforts to ensure the historic task of poverty relief is completed on schedule.</p>

[China urges US to be constructive contributor not irrational spoiler], 2020-02-19 14:59:19,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- China urged the United States to view Chinese companies and China-U.S. business cooperation objectively and fairly, and be a constructive contributor rather than an irrational spoiler, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said Tuesday.</p>
<p>
	There has been a report about the U.S. government's considering a proposal to halt deliveries of jet engines co-produced by General Electric Company (GE) for the COMAC C919 airliner being developed in China, over concerns that the Chinese could reverse-engineer the engines, which will undermine U.S. business interests.</p>
<p>
	""We noted this report. It also says that GE is arguing against the possible move of the U.S. government, saying that mimicking the advanced manufacturing techniques that have produced the engine is far harder than some administration officials believe,"" Geng told an online press briefing, adding that GE has also argued the engines have been on the ground in China for years, meaning there is no reason for China to wait until now to begin the reverse-engineering if it had wanted to do so.</p>
<p>
	If the content of the report is true, it suggests that Americans in industrial sectors seem to have more common sense, and be more sensible and likely to tell the truth than certain officials in the U.S. administration, the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>
	""These officials are ignorant about science and technology and of the market principle, and they are also worried about China's development,"" Geng said. ""It will be another example of the U.S. using political means to undermine its bilateral business cooperation with China and wantonly oppress Chinese businesses.""</p>
<p>
	Recent U.S. moves hurt not only Chinese businesses' interests but also American companies' interests in the long run, Geng said. ""What's worse, it will seriously disrupt bilateral and even global exchange and cooperation in science, technology and trade.""</p>

[Passengers start disembarking from virushit Diamond Princess in Japan], 2020-02-19 12:46:42,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	TOKYO, Feb. 19 (Xinhua) -- Passengers on the novel coronavirus-inflicted Diamond Princess cruise ship started disembarking on Wednesday in Japan's Yokohama Port after a two-week quarantine period.</p>
<p>
	In at least three days, nearly 3,000 people will disembark from the ship which has 542 confirmed cases of the pneumonia-causing virus so far, according to the government.</p>
<p>
	The first group of about 500 mainly elderly passengers who have tested negative for the virus started to get off the ship after finishing final checkups with doctors.</p>
<p>
	The cruise ship, initially carrying around 3,700 passengers and crew from more than 50 countries and regions, has been quarantined at the Yokohama Port south of Tokyo since Feb. 5 after a passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong on Jan. 25 tested positive for the virus.</p>
<p>
	According to the heath ministry, test samples have now been collected from all passengers and those found to be infected have been transported to medical facilities.</p>
<p>
	Disembarking passengers will be transported to Yokohama and other train stations in the area, and can go home by public transportation.</p>
<p>
	Those who have had close contact with the infected on the ship will be kept on board for further monitoring even though they have tested negative, according to the ministry.</p>

[Interview Argentinean academic bashes prejudices against China calls for ChinaUS cooperation], 2020-02-19 12:45:28,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BUENOS AIRES, Feb. 19 (Xinhua) -- Argentinean academic Patricio Giusto has warned of prejudices against China and said cooperation between China and the United States benefits the world in a recent interview with Xinhua.</p>
<p>
	""To fully understand China's reality, it is important to get to know its long history, rich philosophy and majestic culture. It is the only way to eliminate ignorance and prejudices,"" said Giusto, a professor with the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina.</p>
<p>
	The expert highlighted the valuable contribution of a newly-published book -- ""Fake Fear: America and China Relations"" -- to helping other countries better understand China, as well as the current debate on present and future China-U.S. relations.</p>
<p>
	""The book helps remove habitual prejudices and false theories on China and expound its intentions on the international stage,"" said Giusto, who is also a visiting professor at China's Zhejiang University.</p>
<p>
	He warned of a growing number of anti-China politicians and intellectuals who are gaining influence in American politics, and discussed ""the dangerous consequences that this could have for relations between both powers and for the rest of the world.""</p>
<p>
	""The concept of the 'China threat' must be done away with through a critical and honest analysis based on the reality,"" the academic said.</p>
<p>
	During the past 40 years, according to Giusto, China has proven its economic strength to the rest of the world. ""Today, it is a technology power and innovator,"" as well as ""the main engine of trade and investment internationally.""</p>
<p>
	""The world needs China and the United States to cooperate responsibly to confront the enormous global challenges of the 21st century,"" he said.</p>
<p>
	The book, which was published in January 2020 in the United Kingdom, focuses on issues like the similarity between the aspirations of the Chinese and American people, the history of diplomatic relations between both nations, cultural integration in China and the United States, and the necessity of abandoning the idea of win-lose and instead focusing on mutually beneficial cooperation.</p>

[WHO chief mourns death of Chinese doctor in fight against COVID19 outbreak], 2020-02-19 12:47:45,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	GENEVA, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Tuesday mourned the death of a Chinese hospital chief who died of novel coronavirus earlier in the day in Wuhan, the epicenter of the current COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>
	""My deepest condolences to the family of Dr. Liu Zhiming, his colleagues and patients for this enormous loss,"" the WHO chief wrote on Twitter on Tuesday.</p>
<p>
	Liu ""touched and saved numerous lives in the COVID-19 outbreak,"" Tedros said, adding that ""my thoughts are with them and all the front-line health workers fighting the virus.""</p>
<p>
	An eulogy issued by the local health commission said Liu, 51, head of the Wuchang Hospital in Wuhan, had made important contributions to the city's epidemic prevention and control while leading all medical personnel of Wuchang Hospital on the front line to fight against the epidemic.</p>
<p>
	A total of 1,716 Chinese medical workers had been infected with the novel coronavirus by Feb. 11, and six of them have died.</p>
<p>
	Also on Tuesday, the WHO on issued a guidance on the rights, roles and responsibilities of health workers as its latest move in its response to the current COVID-19 outbreak, highlighting the rights and responsibilities of health workers, including specific measures needed to protect occupational safety and health.</p>
<p>
	Noting that health workers are at the front line of any outbreak response, the WHO guidance said that the hazards include pathogen exposure, long working hours, psychological distress, fatigue, occupational burnout, stigma, and physical and psychological violence.</p>
<p>
	According to the guidance, employers in health facilities should assume overall responsibility to ensure that all necessary preventive and protective measures are taken to minimize occupational safety and health risks, and to familiarize personnel with technical updates on COVID-19 and share infection prevention and control information with patients and the public.</p>
<p>
	They should also provide a blame-free environment for workers to report on incidents, such as exposures to blood or bodily fluids from the respiratory system or to cases of violence, and to adopt measures for immediate followup, including support to victims.</p>
<p>
	The guidance suggests that health workers swiftly follow established public health reporting procedures of suspect and confirmed cases and provide or reinforce accurate infection prevention and control and public health information.</p>

Man detained for hunting endangered wildlife in China, 2020-02-19 12:51:57,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	KUNMING, Feb. 19 (Xinhua) -- Police in southwest China's Yunnan Province recently cracked a case of illegally hunting endangered wildlife, seizing 27 wild birds and detaining one suspect.</p>
<p>
	A large number of migratory birds travel across Shidian County in the city of Baoshan between October and April every year. The local forestry police have intensified patrols in those areas in an effort to protect wild birds amid the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, according to the forestry police of Shidian.</p>
<p>
	Police officers found that a flock of birds had not taken off again after landing on a mountain during a patrol on Feb. 3. They rushed to the landing area and found a man dealing with those birds captured by a hunting net.</p>
<p>
	The police detained the suspect on-site and seized 19 Himalayan vultures from the net. Meanwhile, police also found seven Himalayan vultures in a large steel cage and one golden eagle bound with a rope, which are all species under state protection.</p>
<p>
	Feathers of Himalayan vultures, other animal products and hunting tools were also found by police in the suspect's home.</p>
<p>
	Investigation into the case is underway. The seized wild birds will be released back into the wild, according to the police.</p>

[Socalled freedom never an excuse for loss of humanity], 2020-02-19 13:26:53,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	Spanish writer Lola Beccaria who has been living in Shanghai for three years recently published an article on Spanish newspaper El País to show support for China’s efforts to combat the novel coronavirus epidemic.</p>
<p>
	She said that the Chinese are humorous, lively and friendly, and they remain unchanged in the epidemic. The Spanish writer saw the persistence of cities, as well as the conviction, equanimity and orderliness of the people. Everything the Chinese do is to defeat the epidemic, she wrote.</p>
<p>
	However, what’s in stark contrast to this is the arrogance and prejudice of some western media which totally ignored the appeal of the World Health Organization (WHO), national leaders and other voices of justice in the international society to oppose stigma and discrimination. Such practice exactly exposed their unwisdom and viciousness, and will never be supported by the public.</p>
<p>
	Those who go against justice and morality will only receive condemnation. An article recently published by the Wall Street Journal that fans racial discrimination was refuted and opposed by its subscribers. Over 100,000 people have signed on the petitioning system of the White House to request apologies to the Chinese communities and a retitling or removal of the report.</p>
<p>
	German weekly news magazine Der Spiegel also triggered anger of the masses for the headline splashed across the magazine’s current cover that associates the novel coronavirus with “made in China.” Such practice was described as shameful by German internet users.</p>
<p>
	French newspaper Courrier Picard used “yellow peril” to report the epidemic, and was refuted by the French daily Le Figaro who said the practice was blatant racial discrimination against Asians in disguise of humor.</p>
<p>
	After Denmark's Jyllands-Posten printed a cartoon insulting the Chinese national flag, a city councilor of Odense, Denmark pointed out that the media outlet should apologize as it is not a question of free speech, but humanity.</p>
<p>
	The New York Times jumped to a conclusion that the epidemic might develop to a pandemic. However, the WHO immediately refuted it with authoritativeness that the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak is not a pandemic.</p>
<p>
	Media is an important tool to disseminate social information in the modern society, and a major channel for the public to learn the truths of news events. An article of the Time magazine recently compared the news coverage of the novel coronavirus in 2020 to that of Ebola in 2018, and found that the coverage of the 2019-nCoV had been unusually heavy.</p>
<p>
	“It seems to me that the coronavirus is being covered in more sensationalistic terms than Ebola in 2018,” said Steven Miller, a professor at the Rutgers School of Journalism and Media Studies.</p>
<p>
	What people should stay alert to is the “common practices” of certain western media to exaggerate fear and fan up social discrimination. The reason for such phenomenon is their inability to keep pace with time, as well as the “civilization privileges” and “zero-sum games” that crammed their brains.</p>
<p>
	Ignoring the efforts and achievements made by the Chinese people in combating the epidemic, stigmatizing China with racism, and impeding the efforts of the international society by creating panic, these media outlets have lost their sense for basic moral and social responsibility.</p>
<p>
	Besides, humanity is also absent in their indifferent and ugly reports which turn a totally blind eye to the death of the unfortunate and the forces of justice that are still fighting the virus to protect lives.</p>
<p>
	The notorious Wall Street Journal article kept saying that “the 21st century has been an age of black swans”, but it failed to understand the true intention of Nassim Nicholas Taleb who invented the term. In Taleb’s book Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life, he called on the world to share responsibilities in a bid to cope with uncertainties in reality, which is exactly a practical warning for the current time.</p>
<p>
	It’s important that media shall never chase for the so-called “freedom” and lose their humanity when human beings are impacted by uncertainties such as virus attacks. What is the meaning for the existence of media if it arbitrarily escapes responsibility and morality? That is something that some western media should think.</p>

Chinese provinces safeguard returning migrant workers against virus, 2020-02-19 13:26:42,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	GUIYANG, Feb. 19 (Xinhua) -- As more cities across China announced to resume business after the extended Spring Festival holiday, migrant workers began trickling back to factories, but millions are still on their way back to work amid the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>
	On Tuesday, serveral cities in east China's Zhejiang Province, including Huzhou and Jiaxing, organized chartered airplanes to bring over 300 workers from the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan back to work, a move rarely seen before in the province.</p>
<p>
	Hangzhou, Zhejiang's capital city and home to a population of over 10 million, is welcoming back the influx of migrant workers meticulously. Nearly half of the mega city's population come from other regions in China.</p>
<p>
	A total of 300 migrant workers from Guizhou, a major labor exporter in southwest China, were the first to answer the city's call. Compared with other hard-stricken regions, the province is less affected by the virus.</p>
<p>
	The 300 workers took a bullet train to Hangzhou last weekend. The free ride was provided by Hangzhou as an exclusive commute service for returnees after the extended holiday.</p>
<p>
	Rather than the usual stereotype of an overcrowded journey, the quiet carriages saw many empty seats and everyone wore a mask.</p>
<p>
	To minimize the risk of infection, passengers of the train were advised not to sit together and not to move between carriages, said Wen Tao, an official with the Guiyang north railway station.</p>
<p>
	Before boarding, the workers, like all the other passengers, were required to undergo a temperature check and report any travel history to the hardest-hit Hubei Province, Wen said.</p>
<p>
	Specific measures have also been taken to meet the requirement of the destination, including filling in online questionnaires on physical conditions.</p>
<p>
	""Each carriage has an emergency kit for passengers with abnormal temperatures and all fever patients will be placed under quarantine at designated places,"" said Liu Juenan who oversaw the trip and trained the staff on how to deal with emergencies.</p>
<p>
	""We were all nervous about the coronavirus infection, but the conductors' thoughtful reminders throughout the journey helped relieve our stress,"" said a worker on the train.</p>
<p>
	The efforts to guarantee a safe return trip for workers mirrors how the country has been attempting to minimize anxieties and encourage companies to resume operation.</p>
<p>
	The volume of return trips made by migrant workers after the Spring Festival is expected to reach 300 million, among which 80 million trips have been made. And 120 million trips are expected by the end of February, according to a Sunday press conference held by China's Ministry of Transport.</p>
<p>
	Transport departments at all levels were urged to provide safe transportation for migrant workers to meet the labor demand of enterprises.</p>
<p>
	For those who are unemployed and struggle to maintain a stable paycheck, provinces including Guizhou and Sichuan have launched online recruitment platforms to offer short-term jobs for the local workforce that is now idle.</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile, more companies have moved to hire jon-hunters online to offset the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on employment.</p>
<p>
	Farmers in some provinces are encouraged to seek local opportunities with government subsidies and bonuses, as part of the efforts to contain the spread of the virus.</p>

[Foreigners in south Chinas Hainan join in fight against epidemic], 2020-02-19 11:15:38,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	Foreigners living in south China's Hainan province are joining in the battle against the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>
	Lara is an English teacher from South Africa who works in Haikou, capital of the province. Inspired by the news that a man had given his extra mask to an elderly woman who could not take a bus because she did not have one, she wrote an English poem ""Unmasked"" and recorded a video to go along with it.</p>
<p>
	She hoped that through her video, more people would learn that in this special time fighting the epidemic, people must first take care of and protect themselves so as to better take care of others.</p>
<p>
	David Chon, founder of the Chimac restaurant and pub, held a free mask distribution event in Haikou. With the help of some friends, he bought about 6,000 masks from South Korea and handed them out to people in the city.</p>
<p>
	David asked volunteers to teach recipients how to use the masks properly, adding that ""We all have to do what we can do in order to stop the virus spreading, and defeat the disease.""</p>
<p>
	Sarah, an English teacher, was one of the volunteers at the event. She said she loved Hainan, and especially its people, explaining that she joined the event because she wanted everyone in the province to be safe.</p>
<p>
	Marian Rosenberg, from the United States, has been working and living in Hainan for 14 years. For her, Hainan is her second home. After the novel coronavirus outbreak, she felt obliged to give updates on the development of the epidemic and local governments' prevention measures to foreign friends in Hainan, even when she was in Thailand for a holiday.</p>
<p>
	Marian started the regular updates while she was waiting for flights or trains. Every day, she translated at least 10 Chinese news articles about the epidemic in the province into English, and sometimes she translated more than 20 articles a day.</p>
<p>
	""During recent special moments, China has shown the world its strong sense of responsibility and solidarity. This is the point that it should be proudest of and praised for,"" Lara said.</p>

[24 Solar Terms Rain Water], 2020-02-19 11:09:24,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0219/FOREIGN202002191109000059352478377.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 457px;""></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	(Photo/Xinhua)</p>
<p>
	The solar term of Yushui, or Rain Water, usually falls in the first lunar month of a Chinese New Year. This year it falls on Feb. 19.</p>
<p>
	Rain Water signals the increase in rainfall and rise in temperature. With its arrival, lively spring-like scenery starts blossoming: the river water defreezes, wild geese move from south to north, and trees and grass turn green again.</p>
<p>
	Here are five things you may not know about Rain Water.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Water as precious as oil</strong></p>
<p>
	According to an old Chinese saying, the rainfall in spring is as precious as oil. In northern China, the spring drought is common and the precipitation of this season accounts for only 10 to 15 percent of annual average rainfall.</p>
<p>
	Therefore, Rain Water is considered as a key period for irrigation when the day gets warmer and rainfall increases.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Return of cold spell</strong></p>
<p>
	Extra care is needed to cope with a returning cold spell in the late spring that often happen during Rain Water period. The fast increase in air humidity due to rainfall can result in lower temperature and wet weather. It is strongly advised not to take off the thick coats too early and to keep warm, especially elderly and children.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Visit to in-laws</strong></p>
<p>
	One of the main customs during Rain Water is husbands visiting their in-laws and giving gifts. According to the tradition, gifts are usually two cane chairs winded with four meters of red belt, which symbolizes good health and longevity. Another typical gift is a pot of cooked dish that contains pig's knuckles stewed with soya and kelp, by which the son-in-law expresses his respect and gratitude.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Finding godfather</strong></p>
<p>
	Another old custom is to find a godfather for little kids. Rainfall brings vitality to the earth; therefore people in the past believed that this practice would give their kids healthy and safe growth.</p>
<p>
	The custom can be traced back to the health services of the past when many children's diseases could not be cured at all. Therefore, parents wanted a godfather to shower their blessings and good luck on their children. This old practice was popular in Sichuan area.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Nutritious porridge</strong></p>
<p>
	The wet and damp weather during Rain Water period is considered harmful for people's spleen and stomach according to Chinese medical practice. Therefore, a bowl of nutritious porridge is the best choice to nourish the body.</p>
<p>
	People in Beijing often eat porridge cooked with rehmannia glutinosa libosch, a kind of Chinese herb medicine, to resist cold and wet weather and eliminate heat from the blood. It is also good for people with constipation, arthritis and headaches.</p>

Bloomberg set to join Democratic primary debate in Nevada, 2020-02-19 10:19:14,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	WASHINGTON, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg is set to join his fellow presidential candidates for first time on Democratic primary debate stage in Nevada on Wednesday, his campaign manager Kevin Sheekey confirmed on Tuesday.</p>
<p>
	""Mike is looking forward to joining the other Democratic candidates on stage and making the case for why he's the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump and unite the country,"" Sheekey said in a statement.</p>
<p>
	Bloomberg did not meet the donor threshold to qualify for the past debates since he has been self-funding his campaign from the very beginning.</p>
<p>
	However, the Democratic National Committee in January eliminated the donor requirement to participate in debates and Bloomberg now qualifies for the debate with the Tuesday release of a new NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist poll showing that he is trailing only front-runner Senator Bernie Sanders.</p>
<p>
	The poll shows Bloomberg at 19 percent, while Sanders leads the field with 31 percent support. Former Vice President Joe Biden came third with 15 percent support, followed by Senator Elizabeth Warren at 12 percent support, Senator Amy Klobuchar with 9 percent and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 8 percent.</p>
<p>
	The poll was conducted Feb. 13-16 among 1,416 U.S. adults with a margin of error at 5.4 percentage points.</p>
<p>
	Bloomberg will be on the ballot for the Super Tuesday contests on March 3.</p>

[A Decisive Stage for Chinas Fight against COVID19 Epidemic], 2020-02-19 12:11:39,"<div class=""wb_12 clear"">
	<p>
	The people’s war against the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic is entering a decisive stage in China. Under the strong leadership of the central government, the whole nation has devoted tremendous amounts of resources and efforts to this war. The prevention and control of the epidemic in Hubei, especially in such heavily-hit areas as Wuhan, has become a key campaign; and the measures taken by other Chinese regions will determine whether this war will turn to be a war of attrition or a protracted war. For now, a few questions remain for the international community concerned about how soon China will totally conquer the coronavirus: When will be the turning point of the epidemic? What new measurers and efforts have the Chinese government and people taken to fight against the epidemic and with what effects? What new progresses have been made by the Chinese medical community in epidemic control and treatment to COVID-19 patients? And what lessons can be learned by the international public health circles from this war against an epidemic of even greater impact than the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003? This report gives latest answers to those questions from a special research team at Shanghai Institutes for International Studies (SIIS).</p>
<p>
	The reports concludes that at present, the COVID-19 epidemic manifests a trend of localized clusters of outbreak (especially in the City of Wuhan and some other areas in Hubei Province) but coming increasingly in check in other parts of China. The situation in Hubei, Wuhan and other regions is expected to be further improved with enhanced national strategy and measures. Nevertheless, the turning point of the epidemic will depend on the effectiveness of the current prevention and control measures, as well as cooperation of the general public. In the next week or two, China will be faced by new challenges as millions of people return to work in major cities after the Spring Festival. If the number of new infections can be kept low for two weeks, then we can say the turning point has come in China except for Hubei.</p>
<p>
	This report points out that although there is still no direct cure for COVID-19, China’s government branch in charge of epidemic prevention, medical institutions and medical researchers have joined hands in optimizing the epidemic control strategy and patient treatment plans. It proves increasingly effective to detecting, confirming, and treating infected people at the earliest time, as well as to rescuing severely ill patients and reducing mortality rates.</p>
<p>
	It is also pointed out that China’s whole-of-government approach and efficient social mobilization system are the basic guarantee for victory of the people’s war. The many unconventional measures adopted so far -- such as rushing medical staff and other resources to Wuhan from around China, assigning 19 provinces or municipalities to each help treat severely ill patients in a specified area in Hubei, instituting workfrom-home arrangements, and calling for the public to stay home unless necessary -- all will help China to win the war against the epidemic.</p>
<p>
	As this report believes in the end, China’s ongoing people’s war against COVID19 epidemic can lend many lessons and inspirations to the international community for combating pandemics in the future. In the globalized era, the world is yet to be ready for pandemics breaking out in mega-cities. How to strengthen the response capabilities of local public health systems in face of an epidemic? How to gather and coordinate various resources of a nation for effective epidemic prevention and control? And how to enhance the sense of a community of shared future for mankind and reinforce joint efforts of the international community against a pandemic? The key to those questions lies in solidarity of the nation, scientific prevention and control measures, and strengthened international cooperation. I firmly believe this people’s war against the epidemic will give much enlightenment to both China and the international community.</p>
<p>
	<strong>China's Fight Against COVID-19 Epidemic: A Decisive Campaign</strong></p>
<p>
	China is arriving at a critical moment in the war against novel coronavirus epidemic (COVID-19). According to statistics, although the absolute number of confirmed diagnoses is still increasing, its growth rate has begun to show a downturn in China except for Wuhan and a few other areas in Hubei province. Through joint efforts of the whole nation, China’s highest-level prevention and control measures have proven quite effective, with the spread of the virus slowing down and the diagnosis and cure rates on a steady rise. Thanks to timely adjustments of the national strategy and measures in epidemic control, the impact of COVID-19 epidemic on Wuhan, Hubei, and elsewhere in China has been increasingly contained: on one hand, the unceasing inflow of various national resources is ushering in a turning point in the fight against the epidemic in Wuhan and Hubei; on the other hand, imported infections and subsequent spread of the virus in other regions have been under ever tighter control as a result of strengthened measures targeted at the local situations.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0219/FOREIGN202002191306000398604748009.jpg"" style=""width: 466px; height: 292px;""></p>
<p>
	At present, the Chinese government and society are sparing no effort to win the war against the epidemic: rushing medical staff and other resources to Wuhan from around China, assigning 19 provinces or municipalities to each help treat severely ill patients in a specified area in Hubei, legislating for scientific prevention and control of the epidemic by the People’s Congress in many places, instituting work-from-home arrangements, mustering intelligence support from internet companies, and calling for the public to stay home unless necessary. All these unconventional moves are helping China to win the race with time.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0219/FOREIGN202002191309000367693759824.jpg"" style=""width: 415px; height: 322px;""></p>
<p>
	<strong>China’s Prevention and Control Measures Are Taking Effect</strong></p>
<p>
	First, statistics have shown that the epidemic has been kept in check. Nationwide, except for Hubei province, the growth rates of confirmed infections, suspected cases, and patients under medical observation are all a steady decline. To be more specific, newly confirmed cases in places other than Hubei had decreased, for eight days in a row, from 890 on February 3 to 312 on February 12. On February 12, according to the fifth edition of Guidelines on Novel Coronavirus Diagnosis and Treatment, Hubei health authorities counted clinically diagnosed cases as confirmed, which resulted in a</p>
<p>
	sharp increase in new confirmed cases. This broadened diagnosis criteria further reflects China’s enhanced diagnostic capacity and the principle of “leaving no one unattended or under-attended.” (Figure 1)</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0219/FOREIGN202002191216000342038762689.png"" style=""width: 541px; height: 272px;""></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0219/FOREIGN202002191216000507742205583.png"" style=""width: 555px; height: 272px;""></p>
<p>
	Nationwide, the spread of the deadly virus has been effectively curbed. Although the adoption of a new diagnosis criteria resulted in a sharp increase in reported newinfections and death toll on February 12 alone, the growth rates of both categories were lower than those during the peak moment. The growth rate of confirmed cases decreased from 64.54% on January 27 to 33.93% on February 12; that of COVID-19- associated deaths decreased from the peak of 64% on January 24 to 22.82% on February 12. Moreover, suspected cases and patients under medical observation were also on the decline. Suspected cases registered a negative growth rate of -16.38% on February 12 compared with 173.77% on January 23, while the growth rate of patients under medical observation decreased from as high as 253.52% on January 22 to a negative rate of - 1.97% on February 12. (Figure 2)</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0219/FOREIGN202002191218000094344142976.png"" style=""width: 577px; height: 305px;""></p>
<p>
	Second, the epicenter of the epidemic has been confined to such areas as Wuhan, Xiaogan, and Huanggang in Hubei, while the confirmed cases in other regions in China are relatively few and mainly imported ones. On the whole, Hubei has witnessed the majority of confirmed cases, severe cases and COVID-19-associated deaths in China. As Figure 3 shows, between January 20 and February 12, COVID-19-associated deaths in Hubei were 95% of the national number (1,310 out of 1,368); severe cases in Hubei were 88% (7,084 out of 8,030); and confirmed cases in Hubei were 80% (48,206 out of 59,804). After the peak of imported cases, other regions in China have had no new outbreak thanks to the strong prevention and control measures nationwide.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0219/FOREIGN202002191218000325863883470.png"" style=""width: 577px; height: 302px;""></p>
<p>
	Third, the growth of severe cases around China is slowing down and the rehabilitation rate has surpassed the death rate. As a key indicator to the severity and fatality of the epidemic, severe cases have been under most meticulous treatment and with utmost care. As a result, the death rate had dropped from over 100% on January 20 to a negative rate of -2.17% on February 12.(Figure 4)</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0219/FOREIGN202002191219000007330505855.png"" style=""width: 579px; height: 313px;""></p>
<p>
	Fourth, the COVID-19-caused mortality rate is on a steady decline. As shown by the daily ratio between accumulated deaths and severe cases, the mortality rate has been decreasing significantly in Hubei (from 40% on January 25 to 18.49% on February 12) and remains low (well below 10%) in other regions of China (Figure 5).</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0219/FOREIGN202002191219000390532548966.png"" style=""width: 565px; height: 309px;""></p>
<p>
	Fifth, with deeper understanding of the coronavirus and enhanced effectiveness of medical treatment, the number of cured patients has kept rising -- from 34 by January 23 to 5,911 by February 12 nationwide. Besides, the number of cured patients has begun to exceed that of COVID-19-caused deaths since February 1, with 24 more cured cases on February 1 to 4544 on February 12 (Figure 6). In Shandong, Zhejiang and a few  other provinces, the number of cured patients has even begun to surpass that of confirmed cases.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0219/FOREIGN202002191220000026735821671.png"" style=""width: 602px; height: 302px;""></p>
<p>
	The war against COVID-19 epidemic has come to a critical moment. Currently, there are two major views on when the turning point will be. Prudent optimists think that it will come sometime between February 10 to 15, right after China’s Lantern Festival. According to Professor Zhong Nanshan, academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering, director of the National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, and head of the High-level Panel of Experts, the latent period of the novel coronavirus is usually 3 to 7 days and 24 days at maximum. With the nationwide restrictions on population flow, both the peak and turning point of the epidemic will appear around the Lantern Festival.2 On this trend, the epidemic may be over by the end of April.</p>
<p>
	Pessimists, however, predict that the turning point will come as late as April, with confirmed cases surpassing 70,000. For instance, a research done by Professor Joseph T. Wu’s team at the School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, Hong Kong University, published on The Lancet on January 31, forecast the turning point of the epidemic to appear in April based on latest mathematical modelling. Meanwhile, the research points out that “[t]o possibly succeed, substantial, even draconian measures that limit population mobility should be seriously and immediately considered in affected areas, as should strategies to drastically reduce within-population contact rates through cancellation of mass gatherings, school closures, and instituting work-fromhome arrangements, for example.”Now that all the recommended measures have been adopted, the gloomy forecast is not quite likely to become reality.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0219/FOREIGN202002191310000011201801245.jpg"" style=""width: 344px; height: 273px;""></p>
<p>
	In fact, the turning point of the epidemic not only depends on the objective laws of the development of the novel coronavirus, but it is also a function of the collective efforts of the Chinese government and people. As Professor Chen Wei, academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering and researcher at the Institute of Military Medical Sciences of the PLA Academy of Military Sciences, warns, although the turning point is coming soon, the possibility of recurring of the epidemic still remains, and thus it is necessary to plan for the worst and make fullest preparation for long-term fight against it. In the same vein, Mr. Zhang Wenhong, director of the Department for Infectious Diseases at Huashan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University and a member of the Shanghai special medical team for COVID-19, calls for support from the general public, saying that “staying home and refraining from going out is also a contribution to our fight [against the epidemic].</p>
<p>
	Therefore, it is believed that despite the positive progresses in prevention and control of the novel coronavirus, the turning point of the epidemic will be determined by further endeavor of the Chinese government and people. China is facing new challenges especially in the next one to two weeks, as millions of people from all over the country are returning to work in mega-cities after the Spring Festival. If the number of new infections remains low two weeks later, it can be said that the turning point has come except for Hubei.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0219/FOREIGN202002191310000274745068855.jpg"" style=""width: 481px; height: 359px;""></p>
<p>
	In general, strong epidemic control, effective medical treatment to COVID-19 patients, and enhancing rehabilitation rate are three interrelated key missions of China’s war against the epidemic. Only when all of them are achieved, can China win the war in the shortest time.</p>
<p>
	Above all, a decrease of new confirmed and suspected cases will be the most direct indicator of the turning point and a clear proof of the effectiveness of the prevention and control measures. At present, despite the increase of the absolute number of new confirmed and suspected cases, its growth rate has been on the decline for days. If such trend continues for another week or two, then the first mission will be accomplished.</p>
<p>
	Next, as the biggest threat to public health, severe cases and COVID-19-caused deaths are the main roots of public fear of the epidemic. A decreasing number of severe cases and deaths will indicate that the medical treatment is taking effect and that the severity of the epidemic is in check. Up to now, the mortality rate of COVID-19 has remained rather low except in Hubei, which means the epidemic has been under tight control in most Chinese regions. After classified treatment and a greater number of intensive care unit (ICU) facilities are introduced in Hubei, the mortality rate there is expected to shrink as well.</p>
<p>
	Finally, the ultimate victory will be achieved when all COVID-19 patients are cured. Now, the rehabilitation rate is increasing steadily with enhanced measures and capabilities of medical treatment, while the public has developed more understanding about COVID-19 and strengthened self-protection. Both will help reduce the number of new cases and augment the rehabilitation rate.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Optimizing Epidemic Prevention and Control Strategies and Medical Treatment Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>
	According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no direct cure or treatment for COVID-19. Thus, early detection, quarantine and treatment remain the most effective method to contain the coronavirus. The National Health Commission (NHC) has classified COVID-19 as a Category B disease requiring Category A measures in accordance with China’s Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases. Supported by the government and in partnership with their international counterparts, Chinese medical institutions have taken relentless efforts to improve medical treatment of patients and made remarkable achievements. So far, the NHC has released Guidelines for COVID-19 Prevention and Control and Guidelines for COVID-19 Treatment and is updating them according to latest developments. The Ministry of Science and Technology, NHC, and National Medical Products Administration are also supporting research institutions and pharmaceutical companies in their efforts to screen and evaluate the most efficient drugs from all available or under-development medicines. Moreover, the central leading group on COVID-19 prevention and control is organizing resources of all levels to minimize the epidemic’s impact on psychological well-being of eligible people. </p>
<p>
	<em>Adapting Prevention and Control Strategies to Latest Developments</em></p>
<p>
	Based on existing knowledge of the novel coronavirus, the 4th edition of the Guidelines for COVID-19 Prevention and Control emphasizes the importance of effective mobilization and timely coordination among all medical institutions and underscores the imperative of adherence to the principles of “early detection, early reporting, early diagnosis, early quarantine, and early treatment.” Besides, it has updated the monitoring methods, epidemiological survey tactics, and restrictive measures regarding close contacts and asymptomatic infections. For example, it specifies how to detect asymptomatic infections and outlines the requirements that have to be met before those asymptomatic patients can be discharged from medical observation; meanwhile, concentrated quarantine is requested for close contacts in regions with adequate resources.</p>
<p>
	<em>Enhancing Capacity of Pathogen Detection and Clinical Diagnosis , Choosing Treatment Sites According to Patients’Conditions</em></p>
<p>
	Effective quarantine is most important for epidemic containment; and the improvement of detection diagnosis rates is key to patient identification. 2019-nCoV cases are mainly confirmed through nucleic acid tests. At the early stage of the epidemic, large numbers of infections were left unconfirmed and unreported due to deficiencies in testing methods, equipment, and techniques. As Wang Chen, a pulmonologist at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said on February 4, “the two crucial issues in the current fight against the virus are improving the detection and diagnosis rates by increasing the amount of nucleic acid testing; and gathering all confirmed cases with mild symptoms for quarantine to prevent wider spread.” At present, 40 testing institutions in Wuhan have been authorized to conduct testing of up to 10,000 persons per day. As our understanding of and clinical experience in treating the disease grow, the NHC has released the fifth edition of Guidelines on Novel Coronavirus Diagnosis and Treatment in which the category of clinical diagnosis is added to give confirmed cases the earliest possible standard treatment and improve the cure rates.</p>

<p>
	<em>In Relentless Search of Effective Medicines and Treatment Options</em></p>
<p>
	Medical research institutions and pharmaceutical companies around the world have been engaged in the endeavor to find the most effective treatment and drugs. As of February 6, there had been 36 clinical trials related to the novel coronavirus registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, covering a wide range of research domains, including Western medicine clinical research, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment, traditional Chinese-Western hybrid treatment, psychotherapy, and postrecovery rehabilitation. Approved by the National Medical Products Administration, a medical task force led by Wang Chen and Cao Bin of China-Japan Friendship Hospital launched Phase III of Remdesivir Clinical Trial on February 5. At the same time, Chinese experts have identified a number of Western and Chinese-patent drugs as potentially effective in containing the virus, such as Chloroquine, Arbidol, Darunavir, and Favipiravir; related animal tests and clinical trials are being conducted.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0219/FOREIGN202002191311000115088832921.jpg"" style=""width: 401px; height: 289px;""></p>
<p>
	<em>Exploring TCM’s Unique Advantages</em></p>
<p>
	Apart from Western medicine and medical treatment, medical institutions in China are also exploring what role TCM can play in the fight against the virus. Eight patients, including six severe cases, were cured and discharged from Jin Yin Tan Hospital in Wuhan on February 3 after receiving TCM and traditional Chinese-Western hybrid treatment by experts from Guang’anmen Hospital and Xiyuan Hospital, two preeminent hospitals affiliated to the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences. As Dr, Li Guangxi, dean of the Department for Respiratory Diseases at Guang’anmen Hospital, put it, traditional Chinese medicine has accumulated many best practices in fighting off infectious diseases and is now demonstrating its unique advantages in combat with the novel coronavirus. Thus, the 5th edition of China’s Guidelines for COVID-19 Treatment advises medical institutions to “give full play to TCM treatment, enhance traditional Chinese-Western hybrid approaches, and set up joint traditional Chinese-Western diagnosis and treatment mechanisms......to find out the treatment scheme most suitable to the actual conditions of patients and local weather conditions.”</p>
<p>
	<em>Providing Timely Support for Psychological Well-being of the Public</em></p>
<p>
	Psychological crisis intervention is also included as part of the effort to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the psychological well-being of eligible people. To this end, two documents, Guiding Principles for Emergent COVID-19-Caused Psychological Crisis Intervention and Guidelines for Psychological Aid Hotline during COVID-19 Outbreak, have been released. Various free hotlines have been set up to provide a wide range of services (such as counselling, psychotherapy, and crisis intervention) to comfort and help those in distress or mental disorder caused by COVID-19.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Full Governmental and Social Mobilization in China</strong></p>
<p>
	<em>A Race with Time</em></p>
<p>
	Time holds the key in the current war against COVID-19 epidemic; and victory depends on how much faster nationwide mobilization for assistance to Wuhan and Hubei comes before the spread of the deadly virus. Among the 9 million residents in locked-down Wuhan are those already under medical treatment and infected people who carry the virus in latency. Whether these asymptomatic carriers can be put under proper treatment in the fastest possible way is another key factor, as long delay may lead to family and community transmission on a much larger scale. Therefore, the central government is mobilizing and coordinating steady supplies of medical equipment and materials for Wuhan and Hubei, the front-line areas where tailored and targeted measures have already been adopted to build up local capacity in patient admission and treatment.</p>
<p>
	First, a precisely tailored system has been established to leave no patient unattended or under-attended. Severe patients are treated in designated hospitals, while patients with mild symptoms are sent to other specified institutions. Suspected cases with fever will remain in fever clinics under medical observation. Patients with CT-confirmed lung inflammatory signs are gathered in institutions isolated from suspected cases to prevent cross infection. Close contacts with confirmed cases are monitored in either collective or at-home quarantine.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0219/FOREIGN202002191311000309373819404.jpg"" style=""width: 452px; height: 334px;""></p>
<p>
	Second, a three-level quarantine model has been put in place to improve medical resource allocation. The two new hospitals, Leishenshan and Huoshenshan, and other remodeled institutions have added 8,000 beds for severe patients in Wuhan and more than 10,000 beds are expected to be ready for use as more institutions are modified to admit patients. Three makeshift hospitals known as “square cabin” hospitals have been erected in Wuhan to provide 4,400 beds for patients with mild symptoms; and altogether more than 10 such hospitals will be ready for use soon. Hotels near hospitals have be temporarily turned into places for quarantine for potential virus carriers. So far, Wuhan has had 132 such facilities with 12,571 beds. This three-tiered quarantine model allowspatients in different conditions to receive the most appropriate treatment, which helps optimize the allocation of medical resources.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0219/FOREIGN202002191311000444102951242.jpg"" style=""width: 436px; height: 312px;""></p>
<p>
	Third, the central government is mobilizing more resources from all over China to reinforce Wuhan in the war against COVID-19 epidemic. To “leave no patient unattended or under-attended” requires a continuous inflow of medical workers and materials. Thus, the central government has made it clear that “steady supply of materials for epidemic control in Hubei province, especially in Wuhan, is the top priority for the nation. The central government is in charge of coordinating provision of materials in short supply. Hubei must do its best in material management and allocation”; and that “more medical experts specializing in respiratory diseases, intensive care, and nursing will be sent to assist Hubei.” As of February 5, 107 medical teams of 10,596 professionals had been sent to Hubei, most of them working in Wuhan. Moreover, 19 provinces and municipalities have been assigned to each help treat severely ill patients in a specified area in Hubei.</p>
<p>
	<em>Top Priority of the Nation</em></p>
<p>
	At present, local governments around China are shifting their focus from curbing Wuhan-exported cases to cutting off sources of potential family and community transmission. More vigorous measures are taken and best practices widely shared. For example, successful models of social governance in some cities are being replicated nationwide, such as setting up quarantine sites, building “square cabin” hospitals, canceling social gatherings, and shutting down venues for public events. Population mobility is restricted to the minimum level and local residents are advised to stay at home.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0219/FOREIGN202002191312000023909570779.jpg"" style=""width: 474px; height: 357px;""></p>
<p>
	At the same time, public awareness of health and personal hygiene has been raised considerably in health education campaigns nationwide. The public is eager to learnanything about epidemic prevention and has begun to improve their diets and living habits. Health tips about respiratory diseases are perhaps the most popularized knowledge right now: for example, respiratory diseases are spread through contact, droplets and air; main symptoms include fever, cough, and diarrhoea; and wearing masks, washing hands often, using disinfectant, and sufficient ventilation can help protect against the diseases. As people come to realize that wild animals are the most likely hosts of coronavirus, many are calling for the government to totally ban the consumption and trade of wild animals.</p>
<p>
	To guarantee timely and effective measures in the war against COVID-19 epidemic, local authorities are clarifying the respective powers, rights and obligations of the government, enterprises, and individuals by emergency legislation. For example, the standing committee of the Shanghai People’s Congress has passed legislation authorizing the Shanghai municipal government to blacklist those who attempt to conceal their health conditions in the social credit system.</p>
<p>
	<em>Great Contribution of Internet companies</em></p>
<p>
	Chinese tech giants are exploring how emerging technologies can be applied to help fight against the coronavirus. Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu, ZTE, iFLYTEK, and JD.com are all actively employing such technologies as big data, artificial intelligence, as well as 5G in long-distance diagnosis, screening, and medical services. Long-distance diagnosis services are used to reduce the likelihood of infection during hospital visits. Up to now, ZTE has launched a 5G long-distance diagnosis platform linking West China Hospital and the Chengdu Public Health Clinic Center; Tecent, Alibaba Health, and Ping An Health Cloud Company have also begun to offer online medical consultation services to reduce unnecessary hospital visits and prevent cross infection.</p>
<p>
	Big data analysis helps screening in public places. Megvii and Baidu have installed infrared sensors in some sections of Beijing Metro system to take passengers’ body temperature, improving the efficiency of suspected case identification in crowded public places.</p>
<p>
	AI algorithm helps confirm suspected cases much faster. Baidu has made its DNA sequencing algorithm and RNA structure prediction website available to medical research institutions. A whole-genome testing and analyzing platform -- jointly developed by the Zhejiang Provincial CDC, Alibaba DAMO Academy, and MATRIDX -- has considerably improved the speed and accuracy of confirmation of suspected cases.</p>
<p>
	In addition, AI technology has been widely applied to ensure medical supplies. For example, iFLYTEK has opened up its “AI+Office” platform to offer high-quality telecommuting services for enterprises and individuals. Zuoyebang.com provides longdistance education services. CloudMinds offers a number of multi-purpose robots to deliver goods and services in quarantine areas and to disinfect and clean wards.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>
<p>
	Although the COVID-19 epidemic continues, China is well-positioned to win the ultimate victory against it. This monumental event offers China and the world a number of important lessons regarding international cooperation on global public health emergencies.</p>
<p>
	First, a globalized world featuring more densely-populated metropolitan areas with higher population mobility poses unique challenges for epidemic prevention and control. Although mega-cities have generally established full-fledged public health emergency response mechanisms, yet economic, political, social, and security concerns all magnify decision-makers’ and the public’s sensitivity to the outbreak of infectious diseases. Therefore, emergency response mechanisms, social mobilization systems, andreserve systems for strategic assets must be institutionalized in mega-cities. Besides, the competence of community-level officials and individuals’ public health awareness need to be improved through more training courses and mass education programs.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0219/FOREIGN202002191313000019164226835.jpg"" style=""width: 391px; height: 273px;""></p>
<p>
	Second, China’s cross-region medical supply systems and coordinating networks for medical experts are playing a decisive role in the current war against COVID-19 epidemic. Rallying more than 10,000 medical professionals and coordinating huge amounts of medical materials to reinforce Wuhan’s public health systems at short notice is not only a result of the full functioning of the central and local governments, but also thanks to efficient logistics and professional/resource allocation. For sure, China can share its challenges and good practices with the international community.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0219/FOREIGN202002191313000152369901672.jpg"" style=""width: 443px; height: 320px;""></p>
<p>
	Last but not least, international cooperation proves increasingly important in the war against COVID-19 epidemic. In partnership with China, the WHO has been closely monitoring the epidemic and coordinating a concerted international response. National governments across the world have also extended a helping hand. As of February 7, more than 30 countries, including developing countries with medical supply shortages like Pakistan and Myanmar, have donated medical materials to China. Such acts of international humanitarianism indicate that in times of global emergency, international solidarity and coordination, rather than extreme rhetoric and excessive reaction, is what is needed for the well-being of the international community. For, as the Chinese saying goes, “Saving him to whom you’re tied from the river is saving yourself.”</p>

[Giant panda base boosts patients morale via video], 2020-02-19 11:29:23,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <center>

<p>
	The Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding made a video of cute giant pandas to boost the morale of patients at the Hanyang Fangcang makeshift hospital in Wuhan, when staff at the base heard that one novel coronavirus pneumonia patient wanted to watch giant pandas when she recovers.</p>
<p>
	“We will definitely go to Chengdu and watch a giant panda giving birth,” a patient recently said in one of the WeChat groups in which more than 400 patients at the makeshift hospital receive notices, exchange ideas, and encourage each other.</p>
<p>
	When Li Xin, deputy chief of the nursing branch of a national emergency medical rescue team sent to Wuhan from southwest China’s Sichuan province, saw the group discussion, she was touched by the wish and sent a screenshot of the conversation to her colleagues.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0219/FOREIGN202002191136000237897221512.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 318px;""></p>
<p>
	“Some patients have been to Chengdu, so they were talking about the tourist attractions there. Some also mentioned schools in Chengdu. These little details made me feel there was a close affinity between the patients and our medical team from Sichuan, so I sent a screenshot of the discussion to my colleagues. I didn’t expect the warmhearted people in Chengdu to actually help realize the little dream,” said Li.</p>
<p>
	Zhang Zhihe, head of the panda research base in Chengdu, capital of Sichuan, decided to show giant pandas to the patients in Hanyang Fangcang makeshift hospital via video, and arranged for it to be produced immediately after he heard of the wish.</p>
<p>
	“We hope these charmingly naive giant pandas can bring joy to you, and the story of the giant panda in the video can give you strength,” said Zhang.</p>
<p>
	Production of the video officially started on Feb.16. After 36 hours of hard work in selecting the lead roles, writing the script, and revising the message they wanted to give to the patients, staff members at the giant panda base finally completed the project.</p>
<p>
	The “leading lady” in the video is a female giant panda named Cheng Lang, who was the lightest baby giant panda in the world. When she was born last June, Cheng Lang weighed only 42.8 grams, and was the size of a person’s thumb.</p>
<p>
	Although the research team and breeders at the giant panda base were worried about her growth, Cheng Lang is now a cheeky young giant panda that weighs a healthy 18.7 kilograms.</p>
<p>
	“Cheng Lang showed a great desire to survive when she drank milk the first time, which gave us a great deal of encouragement,” said a member of the team that made the video, explaining that they hope Cheng Lang’s story will bring strength and confidence to the patients at the hospital.</p>
<p>
	“In addition to the short video, we are also planning to present a live video of giant pandas for the patients via live streaming. We hope the cute giant pandas will bring special strength to the viewers,” said the giant panda base in Chengdu.</p>

[Passengers aboard virushit cruise ship to disembark in Japans Yokohama], 2020-02-19 10:13:16,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	TOKYO, Feb. 19 (Xinhua) -- Around 3,000 people quarantined on a cruise ship in Yokohama due to the novel coronavirus outbreak will start disembarking as planned on Wednesday, according to Japan's health minister.</p>
<p>
	Japanese Minister of Health, Labor, and Welfare Katsunobu Kato told a press conference on Tuesday that samples had been collected from all the remaining passengers and crew aboard the virus-hit Diamond Princess cruise ship, adding that the process of allowing them to leave should be completed by Friday.</p>
<p>
	Anyone whose latest samples test negative will be allowed to leave the ship with no other conditions, while those infected, or who test positive will be required to be hospitalized, according to Japan's health ministry.</p>
<p>
	The cruise ship was carrying around 3,700 passengers and crew from around 56 countries and regions. The number of infections among those aboard increased by 88 on Tuesday, bringing the total to 542.</p>
<p>
	The ship has been kept in quarantine off the port of Yokohama after a passenger from Hong Kong was found to be infected.</p>
<p>
	The 80-year-old passenger flew to Tokyo in mid-January and boarded the ship on Jan. 20. He got off the ship on Feb. 25 and went to hospital six days after leaving the ship.</p>
<p>
	According to local media reports, passengers have been largely confined to their cabins, although they have been allowed to spend some time on deck while being monitored by staff. Crew members, however, are sharing cabins and are required to move around the ship more frequently, which has posed a problem for health officials.</p>
<p>
	Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, on Tuesday, told a press conference that the measures to keep the passengers and crew on board the virus-hit vessel for a two-week quarantine was ""appropriate.""</p>
<p>
	As for Japan's overall situation, Kato said the country is seeing an increase of cases ""in which the route of transmission is not immediately known.""</p>
<p>
	Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, meanwhile, has reportedly instructed his ruling Liberal Democratic Party to think about postponing or reducing the size of its annual general meeting, which was originally scheduled for March 8.</p>

[Malaysias Sabah state host charity event for Chinas fight against COVID19], 2020-02-19 10:14:05,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Feb. 19 (Xinhua) -- The state government and local communities of Malaysia's Sabah state on North Borneo hosted a charity event late Tuesday to support China's fight against novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.</p>
<p>
	The ""We Love, We Care"" fundraiser, organized by the Sabah state government and Chinese associations in the state, took place in the state capital of Kota Kinabalu.</p>
<p>
	Chinese Consul-General to Kota Kinabalu, Liang Caide, who was present at event, expressed appreciation for the people and government of Sabah for their support to China in the current COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>
	""The friendship between the China and the state of Sabah will definitely deepen after the outbreak is contained,"" said Liang, ""By then, Sabah will be welcoming more Chinese tourists, exchanges and cooperation between China and the state of Sabah will be even closer for a brighter future of both sides.""</p>
<p>
	Speaking at the event, Sabah's chief minister Shafie Apdal said that Malaysia was a friend to China, not only in prosperous times but in times of need as well.</p>
<p>
	""We support the government of China and the people of China. This is the world and we are the people. It is time for us to show our Sabahan culture, our caring culture, we want the world community to have compassion across borders. When we care for the people we care for the world. We are sharing the world together,"" he said.</p>
<p>
	Shafie said the decision to close the state to direct flights from China had been a painful one and had hit the state's tourism sector hard, but explained that the state did not have the facilities to deal with an outbreak.</p>
<p>
	Sabah has been a major tourism attraction for Chinese tourists in recent years due to its resorted beaches, islands, tropical rainforests and diverse culture.</p>
<p>
	Deputy Chief Minister Christina Liew Chin Jin, who is also State Minister of Tourism, Culture and Environment, stressed that outpouring of support for those affected in China had come from the ordinary people of Sabah.</p>

[Dortmund overcome PSG 21 in UEFA Champions League], 2020-02-19 10:17:07,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BERLIN, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- Erling Haaland's brace secured Borussia Dortmund a 2-1 victory over Paris Saint-Germain at the first leg in UEFA Champions League's round of the last 16 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>
	Dortmund played powerful performance over 90 minutes still they had to wait until the second half before Haaland's brace smoothed the way for the win on home soil.</p>
<p>
	BVB assumed control from the start and came close through Jadon Sancho twice. The England international created the best chance on target with 27 minutes played when he forced PSG goalkeeper Keylor Navas to make a diving save.</p>
<p>
	Dortmund continued to make pressure forward but for all of that, they were unable to make the most of their chances as Haaland only hit the side netting in the 35th minute allowing the uninspired visitors from Paris to take a goalless draw into the half time.</p>
<p>
	After the restart, Paris Saint-Germain came out with their guns blazing as Kylian Mbappe and Neymar tested Dortmund custodian Yann Sommer in quick succession.</p>
<p>
	Just when the visitors established their rhythm, it was the hosts who opened the scoring in the 68th minute when Haaland blocked Raphael Guerreiro's strike on target before tapping home from very close range.</p>
<p>
	Dortmund's advantage did not last long as Thomas Tuchel's men restored parity only seven minutes later after Mbappe danced through Dortmund's defense and squared to Neymar, who made no mistake to poke home the equalizer out of the blue.</p>
<p>
	The hosts however had the last laugh as prolific new arrival Haaland collected a through ball from youngster Giovanni Reyna and hammered the 2-1 winner from the edge of the box into the roof of the net.</p>
<p>
	PSG pressed for the equalizer in the closing period but neither Neymar, who rattled the woodwork from inside the box, nor Thiago Silva, who headed wide following a corner from Neymar, were able to level the scores.</p>
<p>
	""My team staged overall a dominant performance. They played very well defensively as well as offensively,"" Dortmund head coach Lucien Favre said.</p>
<p>
	With the result, Borussia Dortmund will take a 2-1 advantage into the second leg at Paris on March 11.</p>

[US lobster industry anxious to resume business with China], 2020-02-19 08:39:05,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	NEW YORK, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- Hugh Reynolds, a lobster dealer from the northeastern U.S. town of Stonington, Maine, was excited to learn that the China-U.S. phase-one economic and trade deal came into effect on Feb. 14.</p>
<p>
	""I hope to resume business with China soon,"" said Reynolds.</p>
<p>
	According to the deal, China promises to purchase more agricultural products from the United States, and lobster is highlighted in the sector.</p>
<p>
	Having been in the industry for more than 20 years, Reynolds' company, Greenhead Lobster, is one of the largest lobster wholesalers in Stonington, a town long-known for its rich and historic tradition of lobstering.</p>
<p>
	""Our Stonington, Maine Lobsters are fresh caught by local fishermen, delivered daily to the Greenhead Docks, promptly prepared, packed and shipped,"" the company said on its website.</p>
<p>
	His Chinese partners in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and many more cities loved his products. More than 200 boats used to go out lobstering for Greenhead Lobster every day, with an annual harvest of 10 million pounds of live lobsters, of which more than 30 percent had been shipped to China.</p>
<p>
	Reynolds remembered that in July 2018, China imposed 25 percent additional tariff on imported U.S. lobsters in response to the U.S. threat of an additional 25-percent tariff on Chinese imports worth about 50 billion U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>
	""That's when all of our exports to China stopped,"" he told Xinhua in an exclusive interview.</p>
<p>
	Many wholesalers like Greenhead Lobster faced the same difficult situation.</p>
<p>
	China imported about 128 million dollars worth of live lobsters from the United States in 2017, according to WISERTtrade, a database that tracks international trade.</p>
<p>
	Annie Tselikis, executive director of the Maine Lobster Dealers' Association, said China accounted for 15 percent to 20 percent of the export value of U.S. lobsters at the time.</p>
<p>
	The figures dropped drastically after the additional tariffs took effect.</p>
<p>
	Data showed U.S. lobster exports to China in the first half of 2019 dropped by 80 percent compared to the same period in 2018.</p>
<p>
	There were roughly 4,500 licensed lobster catchers in the state of Maine and about 10,000 to 12,000 people are directly employed in the industry in June 2018. But then some lobster dealers in Maine had to lay off workers to make ends meet.</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile, business is booming in Canada, where cargo planes are flying out of Halifax to China. Canadian fishermen catch the same species of lobster as American lobstermen do, who are based mostly in Maine.</p>
<p>
	Soon after China and the United States signed the phase-one deal that includes a lobster provision, U.S. Senator Susan Collins called it a significant victory for Maine lobster in a press release.</p>
<p>
	Collins had been lobbying for the Maine lobster industry ever since the additional tariffs were imposed.</p>
<p>
	In the press release, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer was quoted as saying ""this trade agreement will provide lobstermen and women a more level playing field and stabilized access to China's rapidly growing market for imported seafood products.""</p>
<p>
	Tselikis said in the statement that ""China presents incredible opportunity for the coastal Maine economy and regaining access to that market is essential for our long term growth.""</p>
<p>
	While the Maine lobster industry is looking forward to re-entering the Chinese market, industry insiders know it is very difficult to regain its lost market share quickly.</p>
<p>
	Reynolds said for the past one year and a half, U.S. lobster industry not only lost export volume to China, but also import volume from Canada -- something he had never seen in his whole career.</p>
<p>
	Now that Canada has taken most of the U.S. share and the whole supply chain has been moved, it will not be easy to get it back, Reynolds said, adding that he does not support tariff hikes as such measures only hurt business.</p>
<p>
	Ronnie Trundy, manager of Stonington Lobster Co-op, said, ""I think it's going to take a year for the American companies... to get their fair share of the market back.""</p>

Medical experts refute novel coronavirus rumors, 2020-02-19 08:46:45,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	Medical experts have worked hard to dispel rumors surrounding the novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19.</p>
<p>
	Since the outbreak of the epidemic in China, there have been various conspiracy theories regarding the source of the novel coronavirus, which have confused the general public, who lack the relevant medical knowledge.</p>
<p>
	Trevor Bedford, a researcher with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre in Seattle, categorically denied the persistent stories that the epidemic was started by a genetically engineered virus, the Financial Times reported recently.</p>
<p>
	“There’s no evidence whatsoever of genetic engineering that we can find,” Bedford told the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Seattle. “The evidence we have is that the mutations (in the virus) are completely consistent with natural evolution.”</p>
<p>
	The source of the rumors was a paper posted by Indian scientists, claiming the short insertions in the viral genome were similar to HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.</p>
<p>
	According to Bedford, the research was “wrong on many levels.” The genes it (the novel coronavirus) shares with HIV are extremely short sequences naturally shared by other organisms, he explained.</p>
<p>
	In addition to medical experts, media outlets have also disseminated knowledge about the virus to the public using simpler terms. On The Daily Show with Trevor Noah, Chinese Malaysian comedian and actor Ronny Chieng criticized the misinformation and racism surrounding the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>
	He told the audience that it is wrong to claim that drinking bleach, eating garlic, and rinsing your nose with saline solution help prevent the virus, and asked people to stop thinking of the virus as an Asian virus and stereotyping Asian people. The show has been watched by 960,000 viewers and liked by 23,000 viewers as of press time.</p>
<p>
	In the face of unknown viruses, people often feel anxious and helpless, and the demand for information rises sharply. This has created a market for various rumors and conspiracy theories, according to Dr. Cheng Huang, an associate professor in the Department of Global Health at George Washington University.</p>
<p>
	Boston’s Chinatown has been severely affected by the rumors, seeing a significant decline in business. To combat the rumors, Boston has launched a social media campaign that encourages residents and tourists to patronize small businesses in Chinatown, and posts photos on the Internet under the tag ""Love Boston Chinatown."" To show their support, several city councilors have also patronized Chinatown shops.</p>
<p>
	Currently, false information about the novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic is spreading, which is not helping the world make an effective response, Professor and Director of Georgetown University's Center for Global Health Science and Security Rebecca Katz told People’s Daily, adding that the world needs to fight the spread of misinformation, and authoritative public health officials should provide reliable information on a daily basis.</p>
<p>
	The rumors and conspiracy theories have diverted the public's focus from epidemic prevention, and established an imaginary enemy for the people, making them forget that the virus we are fighting against is the enemy of all mankind, Huang said. </p>

[Early Sauls goal gives Atletico the edge against Liverpool in Champions League], 2020-02-19 10:16:00,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	MADRID, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- A fourth-minute goal from Atletico Madrid midfielder Saul Niguez gave Atletico Madrid a 1-0 lead in the first leg of their last 16 Champions League tie at home on Tuesday to reigning European champions, Liverpool.</p>
<p>
	Atletico had to defend for the majority of the game but kept their discipline and shape and a clean sheet gives them a good chance of qualifying for the last 16 in the return leg at Anfield in three weeks.</p>
<p>
	Liverpool was slow out of the blocks and in the opening moments, Atletico was able to pin them in their own half and got an early reward when Saul swept home from close range after Alvaro Morata outjumped everyone following a corner.</p>
<p>
	After a poor opening 10 minutes, Liverpool began to take control of the ball, but all they were able to produce for all their passes were a couple of dangerous crosses from Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold, while Atletico had two good chances on the break, one of which was flicked away by Robertson and the other which was well saved by Alisson Becker after Morata turned well in the Liverpool area.</p>
<p>
	Liverpool's best first-half chance came when Mohamed Salah's effort was deflected over by Felipe, while an Alexander-Arnold cross flashed across the Atletico goal evading everyone.</p>
<p>
	Atletico coach Diego Simeone made a defensive change at halftime, replacing Thomas Lemar with Marcos Llorente, while Divorok Origi came on for Sadio Mane, who had been booked in the first half and slightly lucky to avoid a second yellow.</p>
<p>
	Liverpool pinned Atletico in their own half and Salah headed wide when he should have hit the target seven minutes into the second half in a rare loss of concentration from the Atletico defense.</p>
<p>
	Morata slipped when well placed in a rare Atletico excursion from their own half, while Jordan Henderson fired just wide at the other end a couple of minutes before he went off injured to be replaced by James Milner.</p>
<p>
	The game opened up in the closing minutes, but Atletico's defense kept its shape and the fact is their keeper Jan Oblak didn't have to make a save all night.</p>

Winter flu outbreak claims 15 more lives in Taiwan, 2020-02-19 09:14:45,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	TAIPEI, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan recorded 15 deaths due to serious flu cases last week, raising the death toll of this winter flu season to 90, the island's disease control agency said Tuesday.</p>
<p>
	All the deceased patients, aged between 30 to 87, were not vaccinated against the flu and 14 of them had chronic diseases, the agency said in a press release.</p>
<p>
	However, the youngest of the deceased patients was a 30-year-old woman who had suffered no other illnesses. She died of pneumonia and myocarditis caused by the influenza A/H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>
	About 60,700 people went to hospitals for flu treatment from Feb. 9 to 15, down 27.6 percent from the previous week, with about 12.1 percent being emergency cases, still higher than the 11.5-percent benchmark that defines a flu epidemic, according to the statement.</p>
<p>
	About 58.8 percent of the flu cases last week were caused by the influenza A/H1N1 virus while the influenza B cases have kept increasing.</p>
<p>
	The island has recorded 950 serious flu cases since Oct. 1, 2019. About 43 percent of them were elderly people aged above 65 and 32 percent were aged 50 to 64.</p>

[WHOs decision to not raise risk assessment on coronavirus totally based on science facts], 2020-02-19 09:14:40,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	The novel coronavirus epidemic is not a pandemic, and the World Health Organization (WHO) will not raise its risk assessment in the global context, said the UN health body at a Monday press conference held in Geneva, Switzerland.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0219/FOREIGN202002190916000342096112234.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 284px;""></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<em>A video grab of the WHO press conference </em></p>
<p>
	The judgement of the WHO was made based on scientific analysis of the epidemic’s development in both China and the rest of the world, and has offered guidance for the next phase of global prevention and control.</p>
<p>
	The WHO’s judgement is no doubt an acknowledgement of the huge efforts China has made to combat the novel coronavirus. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the decline in the number of new confirmed cases in China was an important basis for the organization to maintain its previous assessment.</p>
<p>
	According to China’s National Health Commission, 79 new cases of novel coronavirus infection were reported outside epicenter Hubei province on Monday, bringing the number down to double-digits. It also marked the 14th consecutive day of declined growth, indicating that China’s strong measures have had obvious effects.</p>
<p>
	The WHO’s judgment also forcefully refuted the excessive measures taken by certain countries. According to Tedros, WHO has received reports of 694 cases from 25 countries, and three deaths outside China, and Michael Ryan, executive director of the organization's Health Emergencies Programme, noted that no obvious community transmission has been observed outside China.</p>
<p>
	It suggests that most of the cases are still in China, as the country is making huge efforts to prevent the virus from spreading globally.</p>
<p>
	It’s vital to take scientific and rational preventive approaches amid the epidemic, but overreactions, especially those targeting China by certain countries, are obviously unnecessary. </p>

[No evidence for sustained local transmission of COVID19 outside China except on cruise ship WHO chief], 2020-02-19 08:50:12,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	GENEVA, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- The chief of World Health Organization (WHO) said Tuesday that no evidence so far has suggested a sustained local transmission of COVID-19 outside China, except in some specific situations like the Diamond Princess cruise ship.</p>
<p>
	At a daily COVID briefing, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that his agency does not have enough data at the moment on cases outside China to make a meaningful comparison on the severity of disease or the case fatality rate.</p>
<p>
	""We're following up with countries to get more information about what happens about each case and the outcome,"" he said. ""However, we have not yet seen the sustained local transmission, except in specific circumstances like the Diamond Princess cruise ship.""</p>
<p>
	The Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was carrying more than 3,700 passengers and crew, has been kept in a two-week quarantine period off the Yokohama Port, Japan, after an 80-year-old passenger on board from Hong Kong was found infected with COVID-19.</p>
<p>
	So far the total number of confirmed infections from the ship has risen to 542, according to Japanese authorities.</p>

	GENEVA, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO) said Tuesday that measures to restrict people's movement in China amid the COVID-19 outbreak are a correct strategic and tactical approach, and WHO would like to see progressive implementation of public health measures.</p>
<p>
	""This is a very good public health practice,"" said Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Program, who referred to the fact that the government in China had spent a number of weeks pressuring the virus and now actively engaged in door-to-door surveillance, which has led to the number of cases dropping away lately.</p>
<p>
	""We'd like to see progressive implementation of public health measures,"" he underlined.</p>
<p>
	He explained that the first objective in Wuhan is to contain the virus at the epicenter, which has allowed space for much more active surveillance, and by doing so ""they don't want virus to return to other places.""</p>
<p>
	Referring to the latest restrictive measures on people's movement in Beijing, the WHO expert said that the city is a central point in China for so many workers to return to, ""so what China is trying to do is while they're getting success and pulling out one fire, they don't want the fire to start somewhere else. So they're taking very directed measures to ensure the people returning to the city are observed and monitored.""</p>
<p>
	""You can argue whether those measures are excessive or whether they're restricted on people, but there's a lot at stake here. There's an awful lot at stake here, in terms of public health, and in terms of not only the public health of China but of all people in the world,"" he said.</p>
<p>
	Starting from Monday, a joint expert team consisting of experts from China and WHO began field inspections on the prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak. The team members are scheduled to go to Beijing, Guangdong Province in the south and Sichuan Province in southwest China to conduct inspections.</p>
<p>
	According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the team may travel to Wuhan, based on their risk assessment and needs, as ""all options are open.""</p>

China to roll out a host of policies to boost economic development, 2020-02-19 08:16:23,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- China will boost agricultural production in the spring season and take a multi-pronged approach adopted to facilitate business operation and employment, with specific measures including provisionally lowering or waiving employers' social insurance contributions and deferring their payments to the housing provident fund, in an effort to boost economic development.</p>
<p>
	These decisions were made at the State Council's executive meeting chaired by Premier Li Keqiang on Tuesday.</p>
<p>
	""At this critical moment of epidemic control, we must facilitate spring plowing and farming preparations, while advancing outbreak response. For such a large developing country like China, agriculture is the foundation. We must tackle the outbreak in a science-based way, and lose no time in resolving the outstanding issues affecting spring plowing. The State Council's inter-agency task force should provide detailed guidance to facilitate orderly resumption of the manufacturing of agricultural supplies. The minimum purchase price for rice will be kept stable this year, and will be raised as necessary. Greater support will be provided to businesses of livestock products,"" Li said.</p>
<p>
	The Tuesday meeting emphasized that farming is a strictly seasonal undertaking. For China as a major agricultural country having 1.4 billion mouths to feed, spring farming is too important to be delayed or missed. All sub-national governments must fulfill their jurisdictional responsibilities and lose no time to promote spring farming with comprehensive and concrete measures, thus laying a solid foundation for a bumper harvest of summer crops. Detailed and categorized guidance will be provided for science-based epidemic control in the rural areas. Localities will be directed to promptly start spring plowing and farming preparations from south to north of the country. Companies producing agricultural supplies will be urged to resume production as early as possible.</p>
<p>
	Livestock and poultry farming must be intensified. Poultry farmers in the key regions, who suffered heavy losses, will be entitled to loan extensions and relaxed loan guarantee requirements. Resumption of hog production will be brought forward. The required number of slaughtered pigs that qualifies a hog farmer for loan interest discount will be lowered from 5,000 to 500.</p>
<p>
	Major disease and pest prevention and control will be enhanced with closer monitoring and greater preparedness on all fronts. The prevention and control of major animal diseases such as H5N1 influenza and African swine fever will be heightened.</p>
<p>
	The Tuesday meeting urged local authorities to set reasonable criteria for the resumption of work and production in their jurisdictions. Arbitrary guaranty or deposit requirements for companies who seek to reopen should be eliminated. Existing fiscal and financial support policies must be implemented at a faster pace.</p>
<p>
	""Keeping employment stable is a pressing priority in the course of advancing epidemic control and economic and social development. This requires stable performance of corporate China. It is important to promptly introduce policies bolstering businesses, especially micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. Sound development of such businesses is vital to stable employment,"" Li said.</p>
<p>
	""We must take employment as a first-order priority in maintaining stability in the six key areas, namely employment, finance, foreign trade, foreign investment, domestic investment, and expectation. No job means no income and no wealth creation. Every effort must be made to prevent massive lay-offs from happening. Sub-national governments must meet their responsibilities for keeping employment stable. The return of rural migrant workers should be well organized. Sound and practical epidemic control guidelines for different categories of enterprises should be promptly formulated to guide local authorities in setting reasonable criteria for the resumption of work and production in their jurisdictions,"" Li said.</p>
<p>
	Targeted efforts should be made to ensure the employment of key groups of people. Except for regions hit hard by the outbreak and high-risk areas, unwarranted restrictions that make it hard for employees to get back to work must be resolutely reversed. Rural migrant workers will receive support in finding jobs in their hometowns or nearby cities under the existing programs of poverty eradication and local development.</p>
<p>
	Given the record number of college graduates this year, plans for extending the time-line for college recruitments will be promptly worked out, and on-line hiring will be popularized. Enterprises will be supported in adding flexible jobs to meet the online consumer demand. The essential needs of the jobless must be provided for.</p>
<p>
	""Online recruiting should be intensified to have their job seeks effort well catered,"" Li said.</p>
<p>
	Employers' contributions to the old-age pension, unemployment and workplace safety insurance schemes will be lowered or waived to cushion the impact of the outbreak on enterprises, especially smaller firms, and allow them some respite following the resumption of normal production.</p>
<p>
	Specifically, in provinces other than Hubei, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises will be eligible for a waiver of the above-mentioned contributions from February to June. Large companies will see their contributions halved from February to April.</p>
<p>
	Companies of all types in Hubei who have participated in these insurance schemes will be exempted from the above contributions from February to June.</p>
<p>
	Before the end of June, companies may also apply for deferring their payments to the housing provident fund. Failure by employees to repay their housing provident fund loans due to the epidemic will not be taken as a default.</p>
<p>
	In deciding on these policies, full consideration has been given to the sustainability of the social security fund, the balance of which is sufficient to support the full and timely payments of old-age pensions and other social security benefits nationwide.</p>
<p>
	""Household businesses have an important role in job creation. We must swiftly work out supporting policies. The unemployment insurance fund shall be tapped into to issue allowances to the jobless. Pension payments must also be met on time and in full,"" Li said.</p>

[China stresses timely spring farming stable employment], 2020-02-19 08:18:29,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- The State Council, China's cabinet, on Tuesday stressed the importance of timely spring farming and a steady business environment for stable employment.</p>
<p>
	Local governments should take responsibility for guiding spring farming to ensure stable agricultural production and a bumper harvest, according to a statement released after a State Council executive meeting chaired by Premier Li Keqiang.</p>
<p>
	Efforts should be made to promote agricultural enterprises, involving seed, fertilizer, pesticide and fodder production, to resume work, while establishing smooth channels for the transportation of agricultural materials to ensure sufficient supply.</p>
<p>
	The country will provide support such as extending loans to key poultry suppliers with great losses, and strengthen cooperation between slaughtering enterprises and farmers, said the statement.</p>
<p>
	Steps will be taken to restore hog production, help more farmers to receive subsidies and discounted loans, and increase government purchasing and storage of frozen pork.</p>
<p>
	China will also strengthen the control and prevention of animal diseases including bird flu and African swine fever, enhance monitoring and respond promptly to new outbreaks, according to the statement.</p>
<p>
	The meeting decided to temporarily exempt social insurance payments and defer the collection of housing provident funds to mitigate the impact of the epidemic outbreak on enterprises and ensure stable employment.</p>
<p>
	The balance of the social insurance funds was taken into consideration while making these policies and the timely and full allocation of pension funds can be ensured, said the statement.</p>
<p>
	The meeting urged stepping up efforts on the release of epidemic prevention guidance for work and production resumption based on local realities and canceling unnecessary security deposits.</p>
<p>
	The well-planned return of migrant workers and the expanded scale of online recruitment for college students were also stressed in the statement.</p>
<p>
	The meeting called for efforts to ensure the granting of unemployment insurance and encouraged areas hit hard by the virus to open temporary positions for public welfare.</p>

[China pledges sufficient funding support for poverty alleviation in epidemichit regions], 2020-02-19 08:21:50,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese authorities on Tuesday pledged to ensure sufficient funding support for poverty alleviation work in epidemic-hit regions to secure a final victory in the tough battle against poverty.</p>
<p>
	The central poverty alleviation funding should moderately favor regions and projects impacted by the novel coronavirus outbreak, said a circular issued by the State Council Leading Group Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development and the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>
	The circular ordered local governments to tailor support policies for poverty relief works in epidemic-hit regions in accordance with local situations, with priorities going to industrial projects, employment and the well-being of the poor.</p>
<p>
	Efforts should be made to back poverty-relieving industrial projects in terms of production, storage, transportation and sales via means including subsidies, loans with discounted interest rates and rewards to poverty-stricken households who have resumed work.</p>
<p>
	Support should also go to creating jobs, subsidizing the impoverished seeking jobs in other regions as migrant workers and providing assistance to those slipping back into poverty or whose life has become difficult due to the novel coronavirus outbreak, the circular said.</p>
<p>
	This year marks the last year for China to win the battle against poverty and achieve its goal of completing the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects.</p>

<p>
	The United States has been pursuing a policy of economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation against the Maduro government in support of opposition leader Juan Guaido, while Russia deems U.S. sanctions on Venezuela illegitimate.</p>
<p>
	WASHINGTON, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. government announced on Tuesday that it had imposed sanctions against a subsidiary of Russian oil producer Rosneft and its president due to their alleged support for Venezuela in sanctions evasion.</p>
<p>
	The designated targets were Rosneft Trading S.A., a subsidiary of the Russian state-controlled Rosneft Oil Company, and its President Didier Casimiro, according to a statement issued by the Department of the Treasury.</p>
<p>
	""Rosneft Trading S.A. and its president brokered the sale and transport of Venezuelan crude oil,"" said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in the statement.</p>
<p>
	The statement noted that all property and interests in property of the blacklisted targets are blocked. Meanwhile, the Treasury also issued a general license that allows companies to wind down their transactions with Rosneft Trading S.A.</p>
<p>
	The United States has been pursuing a policy of economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation against the Maduro government in support of opposition leader Juan Guaido.</p>
<p>
	The sanction came amid increasing competition between the United States and Russia over the Venezuela issue. U.S. President Donald Trump's reception of Guaido at the White House earlier this month was closely followed by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's visit to Venezuela.</p>
<p>
	""We have agreed on our path of future work, to deepen economic cooperation of investments in other areas, despite illegitimate sanctions,"" Lavrov said after meeting with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Feb. 7.</p>

[Xi says Chinas battle against COVID19 making visible progress], 2020-02-19 08:09:11,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- China's measures to prevent and control the COVID-19 epidemic are achieving visible progress as the battle has reached a crucial time, Chinese President Xi Jinping said in a phone conversation with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday.</p>
<p>
	In the phone call, Xi expressed his gratitude to Queen Elizabeth II and Johnson for their sympathies with China's fight against the COVID-19 epidemic, noting that Britain has offered China supplies in support of the fight, which demonstrates the friendship between the two countries and the two peoples.</p>
<p>
	Since the outbreak, China has always prioritized its people's safety and health, given full play to its institutional advantages, mobilized the entire country, and adopted the most comprehensive, rigorous and thorough prevention and control measures, Xi said.</p>
<p>
	Thanks to those arduous efforts, the situation is witnessing positive changes, and China's prevention and control measures are achieving visible progress, he added.</p>
<p>
	Now the battle against the epidemic has arrived at a crucial time, he pointed out, stressing that China will strive to reduce the impact of the epidemic while resolutely carrying out the prevention and control efforts.</p>
<p>
	Noting that the Chinese economy enjoys strong resilience, broad space for domestic demand and a solid industrial foundation, Xi said that China has confidence and capacity to achieve this year's targets for economic and social development, especially such key tasks as securing a victory in building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and in eliminating poverty.</p>
<p>
	Upholding the idea of building a community with a shared future for mankind, China is not only responsible for the safety and health of its people, but also committed to the cause of safeguarding international public health, Xi noted.</p>
<p>
	China has made enormous efforts, and has effectively contained the global spread of the virus, Xi said, adding that the Chinese side will continue to cooperate with Britain and all other countries in an open and transparent manner.</p>
<p>
	Against the backdrop of increasing global challenges, China and Britain, both permanent members of the UN Security Council, should work together to shoulder more responsibilities and make more achievements, so as to lead the China-Britain comprehensive strategic partnership to a fresh journey in the new decade, Xi said.</p>
<p>
	He said that the two sides should grasp the general direction of the development of bilateral relations from strategic and political perspectives, stick to the principle of win-win cooperation, and accommodate each other's core interests and major concerns on the basis of mutual respect.</p>
<p>
	The two sides should also strengthen high-level exchanges, tap into their economic complementarity and carry out more practical cooperation, Xi noted.</p>
<p>
	He added that the Chinese side stands ready to work with the British side to safeguard multilateralism and free trade, and strengthen communication on major international and regional issues.</p>
<p>
	For his part, Johnson, on behalf of the British government and people, expressed sympathies to the Chinese people over the COVID-19 outbreak, and highly appreciated China's comprehensive and effective measures to prevent and control the epidemic, timely sharing of information with the international community, and efforts to stop the virus from spreading on a worldwide scale.</p>
<p>
	The British side admires China's speed and efficiency in the fight against the epidemic and stands ready to continue to provide China with support and assistance, the prime minister said.</p>
<p>
	Johnson also expressed his belief that under the leadership of Xi, the Chinese people will prevail over the epidemic and minimize its impact on the country's economic and social development.</p>
<p>
	He added that he loves China, and stands ready to lead the new British government to work with the Chinese side to strengthen exchanges at all levels, deepen cooperation in various fields, and push for continuous achievements in the ""golden era"" of bilateral relations.</p>
<p>
	Britain welcomes investment from Chinese enterprises and is willing to strengthen cooperation with China within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, he said.</p>
<p>
	Britain and China, both influential major countries, share similar positions on many international issues, Johnson said, noting that both sides advocate multilateralism, support free trade and safeguard a multilateral trading system.</p>
<p>
	The British side stands ready to enhance coordination with China on the 2020 UN Climate Change Conference to be held in Britain and the upcoming 15th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in China, so as to jointly promote international cooperation on climate change, he added.</p>

        <p>
	Amid China’s efforts to combat against COVID-19, Chinese communities have played a leading role in ensuring the well being of all people and community workers have been working on the frontline of war against the spread of the virus.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0219/FOREIGN202002190829000357709608439.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;""></p>
<p>
	<em>Community workers send vegetables to senior citizens’ homes in Wuhan. (Photo/Changjiang Daily)</em></p>
<p>
	According to the latest statistics from the Ministry of Civil Affairs, since the outbreak of the epidemic, nearly 4 million urban and rural community workers have been working on the frontline of prevention and control in China's 650,000 urban and rural communities.</p>
<p>
	On average, six community workers are servicing a community area, and each community worker serves 350 people with heavy tasks and hard work. The epidemic has tested the modernization of China's social governance capacity and system.</p>
<p>
	""Dear residents, please cooperate with the work of the community during the epidemic. If the community staff makes a phone call to you, please cooperate with us and inform us of the number of members in your family and their current physical condition. If you have a fever patient at home, please report to the community as soon as possible. ""</p>
<p>
	These days, Liu Yunfei, a member of the Party work committee of Caidian Street, Caidian District of Wuhan in central China’s Hubei province, carries out epidemic prevention publicity in the community area with a loudspeaker every day and makes key remarks to some residents.</p>
<p>
	The screening of such ""four categories"" as diagnosed COVID-19 patients, suspected cases, feverish residents, and close contacts is an important task for Liu Yunfei and his colleagues in the community.</p>
<p>
	In Wuhan, the epicenter for the outbreak of the epidemic, the screening of these ""four categories"" of people in grassroots communities is an important part of the hierarchical protection system. For the ""four categories"" of people identified, Wuhan has taken centralized treatment and isolation measures. The new effort to combat the epidemic has been described by many experts and patients as a ""substantial step"".</p>
<p>
	In other parts of China, grassroots community forces are also being mobilized.</p>
<p>
	""Xiao Lei, Xiao Hu, congratulations on your being lifted out of the quarantine today. Tell me what you need at home."" Early in the morning on Feb. 9, Miao Lili, Secretary of the Party Committee of Weijia Community, Dongcheng District, Beijing, came to the home of Xiao Lei and Xiao Hu, merchants in the community vegetable market, together with the health care doctor.</p>
<p>
	The couple has been quarantined at home for 14 days after returning to Beijing from their home town in Hubei province. After the doctor's examination, the couple's physical indicators appear normal and therefore, can be graduated out of medical observation.</p>
<p>
	During the quarantine period of Xiao Lei and Xiao Hu, community workers monitored their temperature three times a day and brought some vegetables and fruits every two or three days. ""We visit them regularly to chat and do some psychological counseling,"" ""Miao Lili said.</p>
<p>
	In order to contain the spread of the epidemic, some areas have implemented closed management in urban areas and closed management in rural areas. In each community there are active party members, community workers, property security and volunteers working hard for the residents.</p>
<p>
	""Residents have gradually realized that communities are the communities of common destiny,"" said Lu Yilong, a professor at the school of society and population at Renmin University of China, adding that as Chinese society matures, the quality of urban and rural community residents is improving, especially in times of crisis.</p>

	<em>Renowned Chinese respiratory specialist Zhong Nanshan speaks at a press conference in Guangzhou, south China's Guangdong Province, Feb. 18, 2020. (Xinhua/Deng Hua)</em></p>
<p>
	GUANGZHOU, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- Renowned Chinese respiratory specialist Zhong Nanshan on Tuesday highlighted the studies on traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) in the fight against novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).</p>
<p>
	Speaking at a press conference held in Guangzhou, south China's Guangdong Province, Zhong said the herbal prescription called ""Pneumonia No. 1"" applied on Jan. 23 had proved effective in the treatment of COVID-19 patients in the province.</p>
<p>
	According to Zhong, researchers are testing on the already widely used TCM drugs, such as Liushenwan and Lianhuaqingwen, to find out whether they can kill the virus, reduce the virus' access to the cell and lower the incidence of a cytokine storm, meaning the massive inflammation which may lead to death.</p>
<p>
	These tests may provide some evidence for the application of the TCM during the early and middle stages of the COVID-19, he said.</p>
<p>
	Yang Zifeng, a professor with the Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health and a member of Zhong's team, said through in vitro experiments on 54 existing TCM drugs available on market, researchers have found five that can effectively inhibit the novel coronavirus infection.</p>
<p>
	""Indicating the anti-viral and anti-inflammation effects of the drugs made from TCM, the experiments give some hope for the treatment of the novel coronavirus. But more clinical experiments are needed to test their clinical effect,"" he said.</p>
<p>
	TCM has never missed a single fight against epidemics throughout Chinese history. TCM classics have provided sufficient evidence of how TCM cured epidemic diseases such as smallpox over the past several thousand years.</p>
<p>
	A specific chapter detailing TCM treatment during a patient's medical observation, clinical treatment and recovery has been included in the latest version of the COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment scheme released by the National Health Commission.</p>

[Commentary Coronavirus wont stop Chinas march towards rejuvenation], 2020-02-18 16:36:41,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- The fight against the coronavirus is a major trial of China's governance system and public health emergency response, and a test of international solidarity in fighting common enemies of humanity as well.</p>
<p>
	Yet the grave challenge that China is tackling, assuredly, will not disrupt the nation's development course -- building a moderately prosperous society in all respects this year and fully building a modern socialist country by the mid-21st century.</p>
<p>
	Throughout its 5,000 years of history, the Chinese nation has never succumbed to difficulties and challenges, internally or externally, including the invasions by imperialist powers in modern times. Entering the 21st century, China has pulled through major risks and challenges such as the SARS epidemic in 2003, the 8.0-magnitude Wenchuan earthquake, and the global financial crisis in 2008. Certainly, the ongoing public health crisis caused by the previously unknown, highly contagious virus, is no exception.</p>
<p>
	Relying on its unique institutional strengths, particularly the highly efficient national mobilization of medics and materials and the pairing-up aid of other provinces in treating patients in affected cities in Hubei Province, China will win the people's war against the novel coronavirus disease, or COVID-19, despite the severity of the current situation.</p>
<p>
	The country's daily new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus pneumonia outside Hubei, the epicenter province of the outbreak, have dropped for 14 consecutive days. Positive results are being delivered with all the unprecedented decisive and stringent measures taken under the centralized, unified leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, such as the city lockdown and the construction of multiple makeshift hospitals. Several local officials, including the Hubei provincial health commission head, were removed from their posts following the outbreak.</p>
<p>
	In another rare move, China mulls postponing its annual ""two sessions"" scheduled for early March -- the meetings of the top legislative and political advisory bodies -- to contain the outbreak.</p>
<p>
	With the comprehensive and extraordinary measures, China has protected its own people and prevented the world from suffering a big catastrophe. In handling this international public health emergency, China is worthy of recognition and support.</p>
<p>
	United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Sunday described the measures put in place by the Chinese government as ""a gigantic effort"" and said the efforts will allow for the progressive reduction of the disease.</p>
<p>
	The control of COVID-19 is at the most crucial juncture for China. The overall confirmed cases on the Chinese mainland had reached 72,436 by the end of Monday, and 1,868 people had died of the disease.</p>
<p>
	Much remains to be learned about the virus, which is more cunning than the one that spread SARS. Critical lessons must be learned from the deadly outbreak.</p>
<p>
	As leading domestic experts believe the virus probably comes from wild animals based on the finding that most early cases were related to a market in Wuhan, capital of Hubei, resolute efforts must be made to eliminate the consumption of wild animals and illegal trade of wildlife.</p>
<p>
	The epidemic exposes inadequacy in China's emergency management and public health. At a meeting of the CPC central committee for deepening overall reform last week, President Xi Jinping stressed the need to strengthen areas of weakness and close the loopholes exposed by the current epidemic.</p>
<p>
	The coronavirus outbreak is expected to prompt an overhaul of the country's emergency and public health management and also push the modernization of China's system and capacity for governance, which is part of the nation's second centenary goal.</p>
<p>
	A Chinese saying goes that trials and tribulations serve only to revitalize a nation. For 1.4 billion Chinese, achieving national rejuvenation is no walk in the park and requires even greater efforts led by the reform-minded CPC.</p>
<p>
	Facing temporary difficulties, many companies in China have made rapid and flexible adjustments in operation and production. It is widely agreed among domestic economists that the outbreak will not undermine the fundamentals of China's highly resilient economy, which contributes around 30 percent of global growth.</p>
<p>
	Going through the trial of the coronavirus outbreak, the united Chinese people are determined to march towards national rejuvenation in a more sound and smart way, while pursuing common prosperity and closer interaction with the world.</p>
<p>
	Tens of thousands of medics in China are racing against time to save the lives of infected people at the risk of their own. Chinese people are grateful for the backing of the international community, especially the aid of urgently needed protective gear for medics from many countries.</p>
<p>
	Zero-sum stragglers should refrain from taking advantage of the epidemic to slander China. Instead, they should think more about how to jointly fight common enemies such as epidemics and terrorism, which are not bound by national borders in the globalized international community.</p>

[China to honor personnel deceased in epidemic control as martyrs], 2020-02-18 16:00:41,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- China has announced a plan to honor medical workers and other personnel who died fighting the novel coronavirus epidemic as martyrs.</p>
<p>
	According to a circular jointly issued by the Ministry of Veterans Affairs and the Political Work Department of the Central Military Commission, the plan covers the deceased who had direct contact with suspected or confirmed cases and were infected with the virus when performing their duties including diagnosis, treatment, nursing, nosocomial infection control, specimen collection, pathogen detection and patient transfer, among others.</p>
<p>
	Other people who sacrificed their lives could also be recognized as martyrs if certain criteria are met, according to the circular.</p>
<p>
	The circular also stressed comforting and compensating the families of martyrs.</p>

[Fact check Is US emergency response system up to par], 2020-02-18 17:11:33,"<div class=""wb_12 clear"">
	<p style=""text-align: center;"">

<p>
	Ever since the novel coronavirus outbreak in China, some US media outlets and politicians have taken advantage of the epidemic to slander the Chinese government and attack China’s political system.</p>
<p>
	Does the US really have a good record in dealing with a similar situation? Let us turn the clock back to 2009, when the H1N1 flu from the US spread to 214 regions and countries.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0218/FOREIGN202002181729000326197501269.jpg"" style=""width: 900px; height: 506px;""></p>
<p>
	The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 60.8 million Americans contracted the H1N1 virus. From April 12, 2009, to April 10, 2010, the virus led to more than 12,000 deaths in a population of 300 million, a number that is hardly on par with the medical standards of a developed nation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0218/FOREIGN202002181732000415229916767.jpg"" style=""width: 900px; height: 506px;""></p>
<p>
	Additionally, CDC estimates that 151,700-575,400 people worldwide died from the H1N1 virus infection during the first year the virus circulated.</p>
<p>
	Well, at least they declared it a public health emergency. However, the US government clearly failed to take enough measures to control it.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0218/FOREIGN202002181732000568614233590.jpg"" style=""width: 900px; height: 506px;""></p>
<p>
	It is confusing that the US seems to have learnt nothing from the epidemic a decade ago. So far, the influenza virus has infected 19 million Americans across the country and killed at least 10,000 people this season alone.</p>
<p>
	Natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina, which hit New Orleans in 2005 and left the city in a desperate state, also demonstrated a “classic failure” or incapacity of the Uncle Sam’s emergency response system.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0218/FOREIGN202002181725000251635670308.jpg"" style=""height: 506px; width: 900px;""></p>
<p>
	On the contrary, China has taken massive efforts to keep the coronavirus under control. Wuhan, a city with a population of over 10 million, and where the coronavirus was initially discovered, is locked down. All citizens in China have been advised to wear masks and many have been encouraged to stay home to prevent the further spread of coronavirus.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0218/FOREIGN202002181733000147673919052.jpg"" style=""width: 900px; height: 506px;""></p>
<p>
	The country is mobilizing medical resources nationwide to aid Wuhan and control the epidemic. As of Feb. 14, a total of 217 medical teams and 25,633 medical professionals were sent to Hubei province, and thousands of military medical experts were deployed to the virus-stricken areas.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0218/FOREIGN202002181733000261747675053.jpg"" style=""width: 900px; height: 506px;""></p>
<p>
	Till now, China has contained more than 99 percent of the confirmed cases within its borders, which means less than one percent 1% of confirmed cases worldwide are outside China.</p>
<p>
	Just like WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus said in his speech: “There is a window of opportunity because of the strong measures China is taking at the epicenter, at the source.”</p>
<p>
	Facts and numbers have clearly displayed the truth: China’s speed, scale, and efficiency all demonstrate the strengths of its system.</p>
<p>
	US politicians should stop pointing figures at others, especially if the US government is unable to act in times of public emergency. At the very least, they can shut their mouths if they cannot provide actual help to the world.</p>

        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- China has allocated the third batch of disaster relief materials to Hubei Province to support the prevention and control of the novel coronavirus outbreak, said the Ministry of Emergency Management.</p>
<p>
	Some 50,000 cotton quilts and 10,000 folding beds were allocated Monday to the province, the center of the outbreak, to help with people relocation and medical observation.</p>
<p>
	So far, China has allocated a total of 198,000 pieces of relief materials, including cotton-padded overcoats, quilts and folding beds to Hubei to support the fight against the epidemic.</p>

[COVID19 WHO says it wont further raise global risk level], 2020-02-18 19:30:31,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	The World Health Organization (WHO) said it's getting a clearer picture of the new coronavirus outbreak, how it's developing and where it could be headed, after China released a detailed paper on more than 44,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases on Monday. Based on previous evaluations, the COVID-19 is not a global pandemic, and the WHO will not further upgrade its risk level.</p>
<p>
	WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus deemed the novel coronavirus outbreak a ""public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC)"" on January 30.</p>
<p>
	The WHO said the information gives it a better understanding about the age range of people affected, the severity of the disease and the mortality rate.</p>
<p>
	The data also appears to show a decline in new cases, but the WHO chief said this trend must be interpreted very cautiously.</p>
<p>
	""Trends can change as new populations are affected,"" he said from WHO headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. ""It's too early to tell if this reported decline will continue. Every scenario is still on the table.""</p>
<p>
	Dr. Tedros said the data suggests that the COVID-19 is not as deadly as other coronaviruses including SARS and MERS. According to the WHO, more than 80 percent of the patients only showed mild symptoms of the disease and would recover. In 14 percent of cases, the virus caused serious problems, including pneumonia and shortness of breath, while about five percent of the patients developed critical complications, such as respiratory failure, septic shock and multi-organ failure. The virus is fatal in two percent of the reported cases and the risk of death increases with age.</p>
<p>
	A team of the WHO and Chinese experts have begun field inspections in China. They are expected to travel to Beijing and Guangdong and Sichuan provinces. Guangdong Province ranks second in the number of confirmed cases in China after Hubei, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>
	The joint team of experts will observe the measures that have been put in place to contain and treat the epidemic and evaluate the effectiveness of the said measures. The 12-member team from the WHO, which includes experts from the U.S., arrived in Beijing on the weekend.</p>
<p>
	WHO Health Emergencies Programme Executive Director Dr. Michael Ryan said much of the work so far focused on coming to a consensus on what is and isn't known about the COVID-19.</p>
<p>
	""It's about agreeing what we know, agreeing what we don't know and agreeing what is the best way to access the information we don't know,"" he said. ""The team will then be able to go and visit provinces and see things on the ground.""</p>
<p>
	Once those knowledge gaps are filled, the chances of containing and better treating this disease become much more viable. </p>

Xi says China willing to strengthen health cooperation with France, 2020-02-19 08:07:50,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- China is willing to strengthen practical cooperation with France in the health sector so as to jointly safeguard regional and global public health security, Chinese President Xi Jinping said in a phone conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday.</p>
<p>
	In the phone call, Xi expressed gratitude and appreciation that Macron called again to extend sympathy and support to China at a critical moment in China's fight against the COVID-19 epidemic, adding that it fully demonstrates the profound friendship between the two countries and the high level of the China-France comprehensive strategic partnership.</p>
<p>
	Since the COVID-19 outbreak, a people's war against the epidemic has been launched in China, featuring full mobilization, comprehensive arrangements and national solidarity, Xi said.</p>
<p>
	China, he added, will definitely win the battle as it has strong mobilization capability, great comprehensive strength, and experience in dealing with public health incidents.</p>
<p>
	Noting that China's various measures are achieving positive results, Xi said that on the basis of effective prevention and control, China supports and encourages all kinds of enterprises and institutions to resume work and production, so as to ensure sufficient supply for the society.</p>
<p>
	The epidemic's impact on China's economy will be temporary, Xi said, expressing confidence that with efforts, China will still be able to achieve this year's set goals for economic and social development.</p>
<p>
	A friend in need is a friend indeed, Xi said, stressing that China not only safeguards the lives and health of the Chinese people, but acts in a highly responsible manner for global public health security.</p>
<p>
	While China mainly relies on the strength of the Chinese people to fight against the epidemic, it is grateful for the help offered by the international community, he said.</p>
<p>
	China has always been open and transparent in its cooperation with other countries, including France, to deal with the epidemic, Xi said, adding that China stands ready to work with France to boost practical cooperation in the health sector and jointly safeguard regional and global public health security.</p>
<p>
	For his part, Macron once again expressed solidarity with the Chinese government and people in the fight against the COVID-19 epidemic, as well as appreciation for China's timely and effective measures and its high degree of openness and transparency.</p>
<p>
	Macron noted that France has provided a batch of medical supplies to China and stands ready to provide more assistance.</p>
<p>
	France respects the professional guidelines proposed by the World Health Organization in responding to the COVID-19 epidemic, and its response to the outbreak is generally objective, Macron said, adding the French Consulate General in Wuhan is still operating.</p>
<p>
	France is ready to work with China in the fight against the epidemic and take the joint battle as an opportunity to strengthen health cooperation, he said.</p>

China smooths channels to promote farm produce sales, 2020-02-18 16:07:09,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	China has smoothed channels to promote the sale of farm produce stock hit by the coronavirus fallout.</p>
<p>
	Vice Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs Han Jun said Monday that priority should be given to the purchase and delivery of agricultural products produced in impoverished regions and called on e-commerce platforms to open up an anti-epidemic farm produce section to help farmers weather the impact.</p>
<p>
	Affected by the epidemic outbreak, sales of vegetables, fruit and poultry have felt the pinch of blocked transport and sales channels.</p>
<p>
	However, the current issue is just a phase and only seen in some regions with the provinces of Hainan, Yunnan and Hubei as well as Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region being hit the hardest, Han said.</p>
<p>
	He urged local departments to join hands in ensuring the smooth and fast operation of channels for fresh farm produce transport while encouraging authorities to introduce support policies for logistics and subsidize logistics firms and personnel. </p>

China to ensure fertilizer supply for spring farming amid epidemic fight, 2020-02-18 15:41:41,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese central authorities vowed to ensure a steady supply of fertilizer in preparations for spring farming amid its fight against the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>
	Solid efforts should be made in encouraging fertilizer enterprises to resume production in a well-organized manner, according to a guideline jointly released by 16 central departments, including the National Development and Reform Commission.</p>
<p>
	Priority should be given to ensure a steady supply of raw materials needed to produce fertilizer, including coal and natural gas, to increase fertilizer output in preparation for spring farming, said the guideline.</p>
<p>
	The guideline also underscored the need to ensure the smooth transportation of fertilizer and called for strengthened coordination of fertilizer reserves and fertilizer imports.</p>
<p>
	Financial institutions are encouraged to increase credit support for fertilizer production and transportation enterprises. Activities including hoarding and price-gouging of fertilizer will be severely punished, said the guideline.</p>

Chinese foreign trade companies maintain composure amid epidemic, 2020-02-18 16:20:55,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	China's foreign trade companies have maintained their composure to minimize the negative impact of the coronavirus epidemic by rolling out new business strategies and actively communicating with their overseas customers.</p>
<p>
	Ningbo Jintian Copper (Group) Co., Ltd., one of the largest copper processing companies in China, which exports products to countries including Germany, France and Japan, has resumed production while taking effective measures to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>
	One measure it is taking is encouraging employees to drive or take the company's shuttle buses to work. The buses will be disinfected three times each day, and employees boarding them have to wear masks and have their body temperatures taken. These measures will also be implemented at the workshops. In addition, the company is also offering subsidies ranging from 800 yuan to 1,500 yuan to its staff to help them carry out prevention work.</p>
<p>
	Gaoke Healthcare (Hubei) Co., Ltd. is a leading protective equipment company in central China's Hubei province, where the novel coronavirus broke out, and a first-aid kit supplier for BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Tesla.</p>
<p>
	As its overseas clients are worried about whether the orders can be delivered or that they might be contaminated by the virus, Gaoke has taken the initiative to inform its clients on the progress of its epidemic control measures and the latest production information.</p>
<p>
	""We are also considering delivery of products from other cities to reduce costs of unnecessary checks for the virus,"" the company's head Sui Jianxun said.</p>
<p>
	The machinery company SUMEC Group Corporation (SUMEC) in east China's Jiangsu province, which has markets in 103 countries and regions, has also done a good job in ensuring its operations are continuing amid the epidemic.</p>
<p>
	""We are working overtime to catch up on production, and communicating with our overseas customers to reassure them,"" said SUMEC chairman Yang Yongqing, adding that the company has managed to export 76 containers of goods.</p>
<p>
	Bai Ming, deputy director of the Ministry of Commerce's International Market Research Institute, said foreign trade companies should make the utmost efforts to deliver goods, suggesting that those failing to deliver in time may apply to the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade for force majeure certificates to shield them from legal damages arising from the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>
	Bai also said the relevant government departments should come up with customized preferential policies for foreign trade companies, including granting loans, tax cuts and loan extensions. </p>

[Los Angeless Chinese community representatives support Chinas battle against coronavirus], 2020-02-18 14:57:48,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	LOS ANGELES, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese community representatives here showed their support for China's battle against the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) on Sunday night by holding a donation and a public health lecture on how to stay healthy during the epidemic.</p>
<p>
	John Kennedy, former vice mayor and a current councilman of Pasadena City, lauded the Chinese government's efforts to fight against the COVID-19 at the high-profile fundraising gala, which is also 28th annual gala of the Beijing Association USA, a local Chinese American group founded in 1992.</p>
<p>
	""This virus is not so easily contained, but the People's Republic of China is working diligently internally and with governments around the world to help protect not just the Chinese people but everyone around the world. I think China has done a good job with their quarantine operations,"" Kennedy said.</p>
<p>
	He said that the quarantine will have a negative impact on China's economy, while expressing the hope that the United States would have the empathy to do all that it can do to help China during the crisis, so the Chinese people can ""live and fulfill their biggest potential in business, education and commerce, and support their young people.""</p>
<p>
	Pasadena City, 18 km northeast of downtown Los Angeles, is one of the primary cultural centers of the San Gabriel Valley, where eight of the 10 cities in the United States with the largest proportion of Chinese Americans are located.</p>
<p>
	Dr. Zhang ZuoFeng, dean of the UCLA's School of Public Health, was invited to the gala to present accurate and up-to-date information on the COVID-19.</p>
<p>
	""An old Chinese saying is that the very best doctors treat patients early before they have a disease,"" Zhang told Xinhua.</p>
<p>
	""Now, the Chinese government's measures, especially the quarantine, has really reduced the risk of spreading the COVID-19 from Wuhan to the Unites States and globally,"" he said, adding ""It's still a very early phase, so we don't know everything yet about this disease, but the case mortality rate at about 2.2 percent -- much lower than SARS and MERS.""</p>
<p>
	U.S. Congresswoman Judy Chu attended the event to show support for the Chinese community and make sure that they are not being unfairly isolated by other people fearful of infection.</p>
<p>
	""The message we give to people is it's so important for us to continue to live our (normal) lives... eat at restaurants, shop at grocery store,"" said Chu, who was elected from the 27th Congressional district, an area with a high population of Chinese immigrants.</p>
<p>
	""Be calm and work together,"" she said.</p>

Temperature screening robots to assist epidemic control in China, 2020-02-18 15:07:12,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	XI'AN, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese university has developed a temperature screening robot for detecting abnormal body temperature in crowds, which has been put into production.</p>
<p>
	Mei Xuesong, a professor at Xi'an Jiaotong University in west China's Shaanxi Province, said manual temperature measurement can only measure one person at a time, while the body temperature screening robot developed by his team can take thermal images of body temperatures in a crowd, and trace and recognize facial images of those with high temperatures.</p>
<p>
	Mei said after the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, the team has made efforts to combine the robot technology with thermal imaging and screening to develop the robot and another robot that can conduct unmanned disinfection with an ultraviolet disinfection device.</p>
<p>
	He said both robots are suitable to serve at stations, airports, hospitals and other public places to improve epidemic control and disinfection efficiency while reducing the exposure risks of people.</p>
<p>
	Mei said the body temperature screening robot has been produced by the Xi'an Youibot Technology Co., Ltd. on a small scale, and proved to have high measurement accuracy.</p>

Chinese ambassador urges New Zealand to lift travel bans, 2020-02-18 15:08:37,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	WELLINGTON, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to New Zealand Wu Xi on Tuesday urged New Zealand to lift the travel bans it has imposed on China amid the novel coronavirus outbreak, saying such measures have already had a negative impact on bilateral trade and education cooperation.</p>
<p>
	""As member states, we should respect and follow the recommendations made by international organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO),"" Wu said in a press conference held by the Chinese embassy.</p>
<p>
	She noted that the WHO has said there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade, and Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, when addressing the 146th session of the WHO Executive Board meeting earlier this month, called on all countries to implement decisions that are evidence-based and consistent.</p>
<p>
	""The recommendations from the WHO are clear cut, and have been reiterated time and again,"" she said, urging New Zealand to lift the travel restrictions it adopted earlier this month against China.</p>
<p>
	Wu stressed that the novel coronavirus is generally under control through China's arduous efforts. ""In a lesser situation, with a lesser risk, why should tougher measures be imposed in this case?"" said Wu.</p>
<p>
	She warned that the restrictions have had a negative impact on bilateral cooperation, especially in trade and education.</p>
<p>
	According to figures from New Zealand Education Ministry, about 80 percent of university students in New Zealand were from overseas, and half of them were from China.</p>
<p>
	However, due to the restrictions, around 40 percent of international students from China are still overseas waiting for the travel bans to be lifted, and Chinese students that have arrived in New Zealand are facing xenophobia due to misinformation, she said.</p>
<p>
	""We need to look at why we have seen some discrimination and xenophobia. I believe part of the reason is maybe a lack of accurate information. That's why I want to have a press briefing to release the most up-to-date information,"" She said.</p>
<p>
	Wu stressed that the Chinese embassy will ensure the rights and interests of Chines students in New Zealand will not be impeded by such restrictions.</p>

Beijing 2022 preparation progresses amid fight against novel coronavirus, 2020-02-18 15:39:04,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- With Beijing 2022 in less than two years, the sudden novel coronavirus outbreak posed challenges to the Games' preparation, but everything went in order as scheduled.</p>
<p>
	The Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games (BOCOG) held a high-level video conference on Monday with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on the preparations for Beijing 2022.</p>
<p>
	""After the coronavirus outbreak, president Thomas Bach sent letters to the Chinese Olympic Committee, expressing his confidence that the Games' preparations will not be affected. Mr. Samaranch Jr. extended high praise over China's effort to contain the epidemic and his confidence in its victory. Although we did not meet in person in recent days, BOCOG has been keeping in close communications with Mr. Samaranch Jr., Mr. Dubi and other IOC officials, reporting important updates,"" said Zhang Jiandong, Beijing vice mayor and BOCOG executive vice president.</p>
<p>
	The construction of the National Sleigh and Luge Center in Yanqing was not suspended during the Chinese New Year holidays.</p>
<p>
	Workers and operation team for the National Alpine Skiing Center in the Yanqing competition zone already returned to work after a two-day brief break during the holidays to make sure the track and the snow meet Olympic standards.</p>
<p>
	Statistics were also collected over how the temperature, sunlight and wind speed affect the snow and cable car.</p>
<p>
	According to the manager of the construction company in charge of the National Alpine Skiing Center, workers take body temperature and wear masks every day. Offices, cafeteria, dormitories, and shuttle buses are disinfected. Migrant workers that returned to Beijing are under quarantine as required.</p>
<p>
	Similarly, strict control and management were also practiced at the construction site of the National Speed Skating Oval, or the ""Ice Ribbon"", in the Beijing competition Zone.</p>
<p>
	In Chongli of the Zhangjiakou competition zone, skiers doubled this year compared with 2019 thanks to the new Beijing-Zhangjiakou high-speed rail before all ski resorts were temporarily closed before the Chinese New Year holiday to contain the spread of the coronavirus. But China's halfpipe national team is training at the Genting Snow Park to prepare for Beijing 2022.</p>
<p>
	Other national teams are also under training behind closed doors amid the current coronavirus outbreak, according to Liu Guoyong, vice president of the Chinese Olympic Committee.</p>

<p>
	The circular also called for minimizing unnecessary information reporting and harnessing information technology to alleviate the burden of community workers.</p>
<p>
	To better protect those dedicated to epidemic containment at the primary level, local authorities should ensure the supply of masks and necessary medical gear to community workers, the circular said, stressing training on epidemic prevention and control.</p>

Chinese family finds common ground in fight against coronavirus, 2020-02-18 14:58:55,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	CHANGSHA, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- Seeing the infection numbers jump daily on TV news, Hou Jianying got the feeling it was about time to end her Spring Festival holiday.</p>
<p>
	A doctor in central Hunan Province's Lianhua Town, Hou received a mission on Jan. 25 to work outside her familiar battleground at a health center to help monitor body temperatures at a highway checkpoint.</p>
<p>
	""I have experience in dealing with SARS, so I shall go,"" Hou said, becoming the second in her family to join the nationwide battle against the novel coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>
	Her husband, a village official, was already on the move to prevent the spread of the virus. Two days later, their son also joined the fight by returning to work in the clinic.</p>
<p>
	When being interviewed on a chilly morning outside the checkpoint, Hou did not see her family situation as unique as millions of Chinese families have postponed weddings or canceled holidays to join the anti-virus fight as medics, community workers, police officers and couriers.</p>
<p>
	MOTHER: I CHECK 1,000 CARS A DAY</p>
<p>
	Wearing a protective suit and a mask, Hou mans an entry of Xuchang-Guangzhou Highway. On Jan. 26, Hou checked 1,060 passing vehicles. She refrained from drinking water to avoid going to the toilet.</p>
<p>
	""Hello. Where did you come from? Where are you going?"" Hou starts with a basic inquiry before asking drivers and passengers to report any symptoms of coughing or fever and measuring their body temperatures.</p>
<p>
	""There was a time when my thermometer accidentally touched the skin of the driver's hand. He immediately flinched,"" Hou recalled.</p>
<p>
	Among her most impressive encounters was a driver from Wuhan, the city at the center of the outbreak. Before Hou asked anything, the driver handed her a sheet of his body temperature records.</p>
<p>
	""Doctor, I was from Wuhan, but I had no fever in the past few days. Can I pass?"" the man pleaded, explaining he was on the way to visit his relatives.</p>
<p>
	The thermometer confirmed his words, but to minimize risks, Hou persuaded him to return.</p>
<p>
	""The driver did not put up an argument and soon agreed to return,"" Hou said. ""To my relief, most of the drivers were cooperative and showed a great understanding of my work.""</p>
<p>
	FATHER: LATE-NIGHT SWOOPS ON MAHJONG PARTIES</p>
<p>
	Liao Shuyan, Hou's husband, began his anti-virus work a few days earlier. As Party chief of the Jinhua Village, Liao had been paying door-to-door visits to learn villagers' travel history and distribute leaflets on epidemic prevention.</p>
<p>
	On Jan. 25, the first day of the Spring Festival usually marked with festive gatherings and feasts, Liao's mission was to disperse crowds.</p>
<p>
	""That day, one mahjong parlor was still operative. A number of villagers gathered there to play and few were wearing masks,"" he said. ""They dispersed upon my advice but some secretly returned in the evening to continue the game, not knowing we would launch a surprise check that night.""</p>
<p>
	Liao's spot checks continued until Jan. 27 when villagers ceased organizing covert mahjong parties. ""I could finally have a good sleep.""</p>
<p>
	SON: I'M A DOCTOR, BUT I PANIC TOO</p>
<p>
	While Hou and Liao were out for anti-virus missions, their son Liao Qian was summoned back to the town clinic, which was severely undermanned during the holiday.</p>
<p>
	To reduce cross-infection risks, the junior Liao sent his wife and daughter to stay with his parents-in-law while he worked in the clinic around the clock.</p>
<p>
	Even though no confirmed cases have been reported in Lianhua Town, Liao said he still panicked when receiving a fever patient one night.</p>
<p>
	""I'm a doctor, but during this special time, I could not help but feel uneasy when dealing with fever patients,"" Liao confessed.</p>
<p>
	After completing all the triage and hospital transfer procedures for the fever patient, the 29-year-old doctor said he felt the urge to call her mother, a veteran doctor in the clinic.</p>
<p>
	Hou sensed her son's anxiety and offered to take Liao's place. The son refused.</p>
<p>
	""No, I just want to tell you to take good care of yourself,"" Liao told her.</p>

[US cities rally behind Chinatowns quell fears of COVID19], 2020-02-18 14:13:26,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	NEW YORK, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- The Golden Imperial Palace, a major restaurant in New York City's borough of Brooklyn, was packed on Sunday with hundreds of people having a dim sum brunch in an effort to encourage people to ignore misplaced coronavirus fears and keep eating at eateries in the city's Chinatowns.</p>
<p>
	STAY STRONG CHINA, STAY STRONG CHINATOWN</p>
<p>
	""We're hearing a lot of rumors and negative comments about the Chinese community since the outbreak of the illness, the fact is that our community is safe and open for business,"" John Chan, president of Brooklyn-based Asian American Community Empowerment, who cohosted the event with local community leaders and entrepreneurs, told Xinhua.</p>
<p>
	There have been no cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia, officially dubbed COVID-19, confirmed in New York so far and public health officials say the disease poses a very low risk to locals.</p>
<p>
	But businesses in New York City's Chinatowns that spread throughout five boroughs, have seen less foot traffic in the past few weeks since the disease first emerged in Wuhan, capital city of China's Hubei Province.</p>
<p>
	""There is no reason for anyone to panic or avoid the activities in Chinatown,"" said Chan, adding they will hold an education seminar on COVID-19 in cooperation with a medical association about proper response to the illness on Tuesday.</p>
<p>
	Chinese Consul General in New York Huang Ping was among the guests at the Sunday event to encourage people to show their solidarity by patronizing Chinatown restaurants.</p>
<p>
	""Supporting one another is the right way that we can get through this,"" said Huang, who voiced his confidence that China will win the battle against the epidemic.</p>
<p>
	""Stay strong, China! Stay strong, Wuhan! Stay strong, Chinatown!"" chanted groups of smiling diners in Chinese when they posed for photos one after another with the Chinese senior diplomat as the event approached to its end.</p>
<p>
	YOU WIN SOME, YOU DIM SUM</p>
<p>
	Sunday's dim sum brunch was part of the ongoing joint efforts made by New York city and Asian American communities to quell the tide of fear and misinformation about COVID-19.</p>
<p>
	""My secret is out!"" tweeted Mayor Bill De Blasio late last Thursday after he held a luncheon together with his top commissioners and local business leaders at a Chinese restaurant in Flushing, Queens.</p>
<p>
	""Can I use chopsticks? No. Will I keep trying anyway? Yes. Should all of you head out to our city's MANY Asian-American owned restaurants this weekend for a bite to eat? HECK yes,"" he wrote.</p>
<p>
	""As they say: you win some, you dim sum,"" Freddi Goldstein, press secretary at New York City Mayor's Office, told local media. ""Don't sit on the sidelines. Get to your local Asian-American owned business and get in the game.""</p>
<p>
	Anyone who experiences any discrimination can report it by calling 311, city officials said.</p>
<p>
	Restaurants and shops in Flushing experienced a 40-percent decline in business, according to Peter Tu of the Flushing Chinese Business Association.</p>
<p>
	Thomas Grech, president and CEO of the Queens Chamber of Commerce, said that in addition to restaurants, places like doctor's offices, nail salons and other service industries saw a decrease in business, too.</p>
<p>
	Gregg Bishop, commissioner of the city's Department of Small Business Services, attributed the business decline to people's responding to ""unfounded rumors and fears about the virus.""</p>
<p>
	Other major cities including Boston and Chicago have also rallied behind their Chinatowns in recent days.</p>
<p>
	Boston Mayor Marty Walsh has launched a social media campaign last week encouraging people to share photos of themselves supporting small businesses in the neighborhood with the hashtag #LoveBostonChinatown.</p>
<p>
	The campaign includes a ""small business bingo"" card of things visitors can do in Chinatown, like trying dim sum, sipping at bubble tea, buying fresh pastries, checking out public art or taking a selfie in front of its signature gateway.</p>
<p>
	Dr. Allison Arwady, Chicago's public health commissioner, said at a recent news conference that it was not necessary for the general public to change their behaviors.</p>
<p>
	""No need to cancel events. And certainly, no need to avoid coming to Chinatown,"" Arwady said, while asking people to ""please do not allow stigma, xenophobia or fear to control your decisions.""</p>

Michael Wood becomes President of SACU, 2020-02-18 14:14:12,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	Michael Wood has accepted the post of President of the Society for Anglo-Chinese Understanding (SACU). Mr Wood is Professor of Public History at the University of Manchester, a historian and television documentary maker whose books and programs on British history, India and China have become hugely popular with large audiences over many years. SACU has said that it is thrilled to have such a prominent new president working actively in promoting a better understanding of China.</p>
<p>
	Mr. Wood will hold two public talks for SACU in his new post as president. In the Spring, there will be one on his co-production between CCTV and BBC - Du Fu: China's Greatest Poet - which he describes as 'a road movie in the footsteps of Du Fu'. The film features readings of Du Fu’s poetry by Sir Ian McKellen. In autumn, he will be talking about his soon to be published book, The Story of China.</p>
<p>
	SACU was founded in 1965 by, among others, the renowned Sinologist Joseph Needham. His major work, Science and Civilisation in China, was the first to educate Western audiences on the historical significance of the many discoveries and inventions in China which predated those in the West, in some cases by centuries.</p>
<p>
	SACU has been working for over 50 years to promote friendship and understanding between the peoples of China and the UK. At its 50th anniversary celebration event, the Chinese ambassador said that SACU’s mandate is ""to advance China-UK understanding and friendship. It is the mandate to carry forward, in this new age and with new ideas, the lofty cause of bridging gaps and strengthening bonds.""</p>
<p>
	SACU appreciates that an understanding of history as well as working with the power of film and the media are necessary for it to advance its mandate in this new age. We, therefore, see Michael as a great asset to help us in the continuing delivery of our mission, being an eminent historian and filmmaker and also someone with a profound understanding of and affection for the peoples of China.</p>

[Interview Chinas tourism market has huge potential for Israel over long term  minister], 2020-02-18 14:27:35,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	JERUSALEM, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- The unexpected novel coronavirus epidemic has created some temporary impacts, but China's tourism market has a huge potential for Israel over the long term, said Israeli Tourism Minister Yariv Levin.</p>
<p>
	China has become one of the main source markets for Israeli tourism, Levin told Xinhua in a recent interview, saying the number of Chinese visitors surpassed 150,000 in 2019.</p>
<p>
	This was a great increase, but ""it is still not a big number and the potential is still to be exploited,"" noted Levin.</p>
<p>
	According to the annual report released by Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics, the number of Chinese tourists that visited Israel last year reached 156,100, up 36.7 percent compared to 2018.</p>
<p>
	""We miss Chinese tourists and I hope that what happens now will be ended as fast as possible,"" he said in reference to the ongoing COVID-19.</p>
<p>
	Levin added that he is sure that ""the Chinese government is doing its best in order to create a situation that all this problem will be behind us.""</p>
<p>
	The epidemic no doubt is a challenge for the tourism industry and people naturally are scared and would postpone their travels, but in the end people will go on vacations. ""I am sure we will overcome it,"" said Levin.</p>
<p>
	Levin believed the flow of Chinese tourists to Israel will continue and grow once the problem is solved.</p>
<p>
	""The relations between Israel and China are strong and Chinese tourists are very welcomed all the time,"" he said. ""I hope that we will see China is big and strong as usual.""</p>
<p>
	Levin has come to China for several times as a tourism minister and traveled to various Chinese cities. He said he was ""very impressed"" by the country every time he visits.</p>
<p>
	Both Israel and China have been working closely to strengthen cooperation and exchanges to tap into the great potential in the two countries' tourism industries.</p>
<p>
	""I actually grew up among books in Chinese,"" he said, adding that his mother was one of the first Israelis to learn Chinese and was head of the Asian and African department of the Israeli National Library.</p>
<p>
	""China has a unique history and has an important place in the heritage of the world,"" noted Levin.</p>
<p>
	Thanks to the closer ties between China and Israel, a number of non-stop flights have been in operation, serving as a significant bridge for tourism and people-to-people exchanges between the two nations.</p>

        <p>
	Enterprises in China are now engaging in cross-industry production to help the country get through the current novel coronavirus epidemic.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0218/FOREIGN202002181429000379107044170.jpeg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;""></p>
<p>
	<em>Workers make masks at SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile's production lines. (Photo/China Daily)</em></p>
<p>
	For instance, several of the country’s auto companies are now converting their assembly lines to churn out masks – items that are currently in huge demand in China.</p>
<p>
	According to China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, China’s daily production of masks stands at around 20 million, including 2.2 million for surgical use and 600,000 N95 respirators - the type best suited to guard against viruses. However, the country is still suffering a severe shortage of masks, and the suspension of production during the Chinese New Year holiday has put extra strain on the supply of masks across the country.</p>
<p>
	Both the sound-proof materials used in automobiles and masks are made from polypropylene fiber nonwovens, so it’s not hard for carmakers to turn automobile workshops into mask production lines. In addition, auto factories usually have wide spaces and skilled workers.</p>
<p>
	At present, more and more Chinese enterprises are joining forces to produce emergency supplies such as masks and protective suits.</p>
<p>
	On Feb. 13, the first batch of masks produced by SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile rolled off production lines. The company has gone viral for the slogan it printed on the packages of the masks – “We make what people need”. Now, the company has obtained the required qualifications to produce masks and conduct related businesses.</p>
<p>
	Since Feb. 2, the daily production of masks has been rising gradually, and the capacity utilization rate for non-N95 masks reached 106 percent. The figure is above 100 percent in 10 provinces.</p>
<p>
	In addition, many gas stations in the country are also engaging in cross-industry business. The Sinopec Beijing Oil Products Company has launched vegetable delivery services at 340 of its stations, selling around 600 boxes of vegetables each day. The boxes weigh about 7 kilograms each, and can feed a family of three for three days. They are loaded in the trunks of customers’ vehicles in just two minutes after the latter places an order.</p>
<p>
	Such services have made life much more convenient for citizens amid the epidemic who are finding it increasingly difficult to access daily necessities, and have also greatly lowered the frequency of physical contact.  </p>

[WHO head pays tribute to Chinese nurses calls for more solidarity], 2020-02-18 14:25:12,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	GENEVA, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Monday paid tribute to nurses working on the frontline to stop the COVID-19 outbreak, saying that this year more than ever the world must show solidarity with them.</p>
<p>
	Retweeting a Xinhua video posted earlier on Monday, the WHO chief said that health workers, including nurses, are bearing the biggest burden in the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>
	The video, produced and posted by Xinhua on twitter, told a story on how six nurses at an isolation points in China's Anhui Province care for two children whose parents were infected with novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>
	""This touching video shows the efforts and love nurses are investing in their jobs and patients to save lives. This year more than ever we must show our solidarity and support nurses and midwives,"" Tedros said.</p>
<p>
	The World Health Assembly has designated the year 2020 as the International Year of the Nurse and the Midwife.</p>
<p>
	A latest report by the WHO said that nurses and midwives play a vital role in providing health services, and the world needs 9 million more nurses and midwives if it is to achieve universal health coverage by 2030.</p>
<p>
	Earlier this month when reporting to the 146th Meeting of the Executive Board of WHO, Tedros said that health workers are vital to achieving universal health coverage, especially nurses and midwives.</p>
<p>
	""The Year of the Nurse and the Midwife gives us a wonderful opportunity to highlight the incredible role nurses and midwives play, and to draw attention to the shortfall of 9 million nurses and midwives the world is facing between now and 2030,"" he said.</p>
<p>
	""We're calling on all countries to invest in nurses and midwives as part of their commitment to universal health coverage,"" he added.</p>

[China responds rapidly efficiently to COVID19 outbreak], 2020-02-18 14:34:40,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- China has taken necessary stringent measures in time to contain the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), according to Brazilian experts and officials.</p>
<p>
	Given the scale of trade and travel between the countries nowadays, China's timely sharing of information with foreign experts is the key to effectively combating such an epidemic outbreak, said Marilda Siqueira, a microbiologist at Brazil's Oswaldo Cruz Foundation for medical research.</p>
<p>
	""In today's world, it's no longer possible to do science on your own or to control a disease on your own,"" Siqueira told Xinhua.</p>
<p>
	""Communication and the exchange of information are vital for the world to handle all of the challenges that come up,"" said Siqueira.</p>
<p>
	Siqueira, who heads the foundation's Respiratory Virus and Measles Laboratory, is a consultant for the World Health Organization and has many years of experience in international cooperation on infectious diseases, such as Zika.</p>
<p>
	Brazil is confident of China's fight against the outbreak, which was clearly demonstrated in its decision not to impose any travel restrictions on Chinese visitors.</p>
<p>
	More than 300,000 Chinese people live in Brazil, according to Chinese Ambassador to Brazil Yang Wanming, adding that he has received numerous messages of sympathies from Brazilians.</p>
<p>
	Due to Brazil's own struggle with a Zika outbreak in 2015 and its long-running battle against dengue, Brazilians have a better understanding of how to deal with epidemics, Yang said.</p>
<p>
	They know, for example, that ""rumors and panic can cause more fear than the epidemic itself,"" he said.</p>
<p>
	Brazilian diplomat Germano Correa traveled to the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, to evacuate Brazilian nationals, and has been with them throughout their quarantine in Anapolis in central Brazil.</p>
<p>
	Correa told Xinhua that the Chinese authorities were quick to take efficient procedures needed to help evacuate the Brazilian nationals.</p>
<p>
	Brazilian think tank BRICS Policy Center held a seminar on the potential impact of the coronavirus on the global economy and policy, in which Li Yang, China's consul general in Rio de Janeiro, predicted that the health crisis could affect China's economy in the short term, while some sectors, such as new technologies and artificial intelligence, may see a development boost.</p>
<p>
	The crisis could also contribute to multilateral institutions and global governance through stepped-up exchanges in information, experience and cooperation between countries in a bid to prevent future outbreaks, said Li.</p>

Shandong medical team in Hubei isolation ward praised for sign language system, 2020-02-18 13:12:31,"<div class=""wb_12 clear"">
	<p>
	A system of hand signs recently invented by the second batch of medical staff dispatched by east China’s Shandong province to central China’s Hubei, the province hit worst by the novel coronavirus outbreak, has received widespread praise in the country.</p>
<p>
	The special sign language system was created on Feb.12 by medical workers from Shandong who came to provide assistance in Huanggang, one of the hardest-hit cities in Hubei province, and was developed to help medical workers communicate with each other and patients.</p>
<p>
	According to Xu Jianxiu, a member of the medical team working in a makeshift hospital built to treat patients infected with the novel coronavirus in Huanggang, the isolation area and semi-contaminated area where they work are closed off, and all the medical workers wear thick protective clothing, face masks and protective goggles, making it extremely difficult for them to hear each other.</p>
<p>
	“Most of the time we use pagers, mobile phones, or written messages to exchange information about patients with each other and give advice to patients,” said Xu, adding that when they communicate with each other over the phone they have to repeat themselves several times before making their messages clear.</p>
<p>
	The medical workers then used hand signs when they found it difficult to communicate through other means, said Xu, explaining that as it turned out, hand signs not only save time, but also improve work efficiency.</p>
<p>
	“Post-80s and post-90s members of our team suggested we make a video to systemize the signals so that we can use them to better help with our teamwork,” Xu said.</p>
<p>
	The final version of the hand signs, which are simple and clear, was decided upon after discussion on Feb.12, and has been quickly put into use in communication with patients.</p>
<p>
	The sign language has quickly gone viral on the Internet after video and photos of it were put online by reporters. Many netizens praised the smart idea and the professional dedication of the medical workers who created it.</p>
<p>
	“I thought the movements were cute when I saw them for the first time. I admired the idea when I watched the video for the second time. But I wanted to cry when I watch the video for the third time,” said an Internet user.</p>

	<em>Y-20 large transport aircraft (Photo/China Pictorial)</em></p>
<p>
	11 transport aircraft of the People's Liberation Army Air Force, including six Y-20 large transport aircraft, sent medics and supplies to virus-hit Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei province, on Feb. 13.</p>
<p>
	This was the first time the Y-20 has been used in non-military action. It was also the first time for the Air Force to send large and medium transport aircraft on active service to carry out urgent air transport tasks on a large scale.</p>
<p>
	The previous day, two self-developed Z-8 transport helicopters sent four tons of emergency medical supplies to coronavirus-hit cities near Wuhan, including Xiangyang and Yichang.</p>
<p>
	Drones have emerged as efficient tools in the fight against the epidemic. Qianxun Spatial Intelligence Inc., a company that uses China's homegrown BeiDou Navigation Satellite System for location and data analysis services, launched a program to support drones in taking up tasks to contain the virus on Feb. 10.</p>
<p>
	Drones can perform tasks including spraying disinfectant liquid and delivering supplies. The first batch of drones for this purpose delivered 70kg of emergency medical supplies to Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, a major hospital designated to admit confirmed cases in the city, on Feb. 13.</p>
<p>
	China's self-developed 5G technology is also playing a unique role in the battle against the epidemic. The country's three telecom giants, China Telecom, China Mobile and China Unicom, have rolled out 5G-powered telemedicine systems, or inspection robots, that can measure people's body temperature at hospitals.</p>
<p>
	In addition, China's self-developed ""mobile hospital"" vehicles, negative pressure ambulances and the latest medical waste incinerators have been put into use in Wuhan.</p>
<p>
	Infrared fever screening systems used for checking people's body temperature and 3D-printed medical goggles have also been used in the prevention and control of COVID-19.</p>

	Last week, a music video to show worldwide support for China’s efforts against the COVID-19 went viral on Chinese social media.</p>
<p>
	The song, China, You Are Not Alone, was adapted from a song by Michael Jackson. All the lead singers in the video are from Cuba while the other participants are of various nationalities.</p>
<p>
	They recorded audio and video materials with their mobile phones and other tools from their homes in different cities, and then sent them to Shenzhen Meifeiya Culture Communication Co. Ltd, where the video was finally compiled and finished.</p>

<p>
	Annie Xu, the founder of the company from China, initiated the creation of the production.</p>
<p>
	“At first, we planned to donate money, but we didn’t know how to donate, and it was not much actually. So we decided to use what we are good at to contribute our part — music. Everyone agreed and we started to work on it,” Xu said.</p>
<p>
	The idea was backed up by the employees, a group of expat musicians who live in China.</p>
<p>
	“We are surprised that the video was so much liked. Many people sent messages to us to show appreciation,” Xu told People’s Daily on Monday. “It’s our simple wish that the music can bring people some warmth and encouragement.”</p>
<p>
	The musicians who took part in the video’s making were also happy to do something meaningful at this particular time. “They all study and work in China, which they take it as their second home,” Xu said.</p>
<p>
	Daymara Viñals Acosta, from Cuba, a lead singer in the video who lives in Guangzhou, said she is so sad that many people in China are suffering from the epidemic and China is having a bad time.</p>
<p>
	“[We hope] to give encouragement to the Chinese people, that they know they are not alone, even going through this difficult moment, the world supports them,” Acosta told People’s Daily via WeChat on Sunday.</p>
<p>
	She is impressed by the nation’s concerted efforts in fighting against the virus and is confident in the victory. “It is well controlled, everywhere you take the temperature,” she said. “I think that Chinese doctors have a lot of capacity and experience and have everything under control.”</p>
<p>
	Xu said they are preparing another song for those people who are separated from their loved ones due to the epidemic.</p>

        <p>
	TIANJIN, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- Villagers in Huozhuangzi, northern China's Tianjin Municipality, has become familiar with the ""buzzing"" sound of flying drones, which regularly spray disinfectant in every corner of public areas these days.</p>
<p>
	The sound is not that annoying, as the work can be finished in one hour, besides everyone is aware of the importance of disinfection amid China's national fight against the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, said Huo Junxin, chairman of Xinshunyue Agricultural Machinery Cooperative.</p>
<p>
	He said the cooperative has two unmanned aerial vehicles for spraying pesticides on rice and cornfields. Now they are used to spray disinfectant liquid on streets, schools, parks and other public spaces.</p>
<p>
	He said he only needs to set flight parameters such as height and range, before watching the drones hovering for the work.</p>
<p>
	""It saves a lot of manpower while avoiding cross-infection in the work,"" Huo said.</p>
<p>
	Rural cooperatives have played an important role in epidemic prevention and control work in China's rural areas by introducing agricultural tools like drones and tractors for mass disinfection work in villages and towns.</p>
<p>
	""Doing the work with agricultural machinery and equipment reflects the wisdom of farmers and improves work efficiency,"" said Zhang Kai, secretary of the Party Committee of Tianjin Beichen District Agricultural and Rural Committee.</p>

[Grenada welcomes Chinese people Grenadian ambassador], 2020-02-18 14:06:34,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	Having travelled around China, Abbie S. David, Grenadian ambassador to China, now has a deeper knowledge of the country. According to her, China boasts a variety of natural landscapes, diverse cultures and warm-hearted people.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0218/FOREIGN202002181408000155982644998.jpg"" style=""width: 400px; height: 330px;""></p>

<p>
	The Chinese government has made a great achievement in lifting an annual average of over 10 million people out of poverty, she said.</p>
<p>
	Grenada is one of the few countries that allow Chinese tourists to visit without having to apply for a visa. According to the Grenadian ambassador, more and more Chinese have visited Grenada, and learning Mandarin has become a trend among the Grenadian people.</p>
<p>
	Many Grenadian people have grown fond of Mandarin, which helps them to understand China and form friendly relations with the Chinese people, she said.</p>
<p>
	China-contracted projects in Grenada, such as stadiums and buildings, also demonstrate the sincerity and loyalty of the Chinese people. In December 2015, China’s naval hospital ship Peace Ark provided medical services for 9,057 people in Grenada over six days, a move that was highly praised by the local people, the ambassador pointed out.</p>
<p>
	In 2018, China and Grenada signed a Memorandum of Understanding on promoting Belt and Road cooperation, which not only facilitates the overseas sales of Grenada’s agricultural products, but also makes it easier for Chinese people to visit Grenada. The Belt and Road Initiative is providing great possibilities for Grenada to further participate in economic globalization, said Abbie S. David.</p>

[Chinas industrial workforce nears 200 mln many highlyskilled], 2020-02-18 14:07:14,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- China's industrial workers in sectors like transportation and mining have been expanding fast since 2017, nearing 200 million so far, official data showed.</p>
<p>
	The country is also home to about 170 million skilled workers, while highly-skilled workers amount to some 48 million, data from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) showed.</p>
<p>
	China has taken measures to further cultivate its industrial workforce like hosting more than 60 professional skills competitions every year and expanding union membership, following the release of an official reform plan in 2017.</p>
<p>
	The reform plan characterized industrial workers as a pillar for creating social wealth and innovation, as well as building China into a world manufacturing power.</p>
<p>
	The ACFTU helped fund 80 innovation projects for workers totaling 12.8 million yuan (about 1.8 million U.S. dollars) in 2017 and 2018, while apprenticeship programs led by the Ministry of Education cover 90,000 people each year.</p>

[WHO says Chinas paper important in enabling it to provide advice], 2020-02-18 14:11:56,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	GENEVA, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO) said Monday that China's latest epidemiological paper on COVID-19 is important in enabling it to provide advice to other countries.</p>
<p>
	With detailed data on more than 44,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, the paper, released in China on Monday, offers ""a better understanding about the age range of people affected, the severity of the disease and the mortality rate,"" WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.</p>
<p>
	""They are very important in enabling WHO to provide good evidence-based advice to countries. We encourage all countries to share their data publicly,"" he said.</p>
<p>
	As more data coming in from China are depicting a clearer picture of the outbreak, such as how it's developing and where it could be headed, the COVID-19 is ""not as deadly as other coronaviruses including SARS and MERS.""</p>
<p>
	More than 80 percent of patients have mild disease and will recover; the virus causes severe disease in about 14 percent of cases, including pneumonia and shortness of breath; about 5 percent of patients have critical disease including respiratory failure, septic shock and multi-organ failure; and in only 2 percent of reported cases, the virus is fatal, according to WHO, which added that relatively few cases were among children and more research is needed to understand why.</p>
<p>
	Currently, a WHO team of international experts are in China working with their Chinese counterparts to better understand those gaps and improve the understanding of the outbreak, Tedros said.</p>
<p>
	He reiterated the importance of taking the window of opportunity to fight the virus, as most cases are confined inside China, while urging the international community to fulfill the 675-million-U.S.-dollar WHO fund to support countries in preparing for the outbreak.</p>
<p>
	Despite an appearing decrease of new COVID-19 cases in China, Tedros said that it's still too early to tell if the decline will continue.</p>
<p>
	An appearing decline in new cases, as is shown in the paper, ""must be interpreted very cautiously; trends can change as new populations are affected,"" Tedros said.</p>

Cooking apps lead culinary revival during virus outbreak, 2020-02-18 10:39:26,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- Wearing a mask, chef Wang Ruofei enters a livestreaming room and introduces the process of cooking an ox bone. The show draws more than 50,000 viewers and helps sell 1,217 sets of half-prepared ingredients for ox bone soup and spicy lamb spine hot pot.</p>
<p>
	Wang is a five-star chef of Xibei, a leading Chinese catering chain brand. With an annual sales revenue of up to 6 billion yuan (850 million U.S. dollars) and more than 20,000 employees, Xibei was one of the first to feel the pinch amid the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>
	China reported 2,048 new confirmed cases of novel coronavirus infection and 105 deaths on Sunday from 31 provincial-level regions and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps.</p>
<p>
	Among the deaths, 100 were in Hubei Province, three in Henan, and two in Guangdong. Another 1,563 new suspected cases were reported Sunday.</p>
<p>
	As the virus outbreak takes its toll, many Chinese catering companies are trying new ways to boost business, with some resorting to online cooking applications to shield themselves from the impact.</p>
<p>
	Staying indoors to avoid infection, many families in China have chosen to buy raw cooking materials and cook three meals a day at home. This has created huge online traffic for cooking apps, and drawn the public to look into the apps to develop new dishes at home.</p>
<p>
	Many actors, singers and other online celebrities have recorded videos and taken pictures of themselves cooking, and uploaded the videos and photos on the apps. According to recipe sharing platform douguo.com, its mobile app saw a spike of 113.47 percent of active daily users during the Spring Festival period. On microblog Sina Weibo, a food-related account has attracted 696,000 netizens.</p>
<p>
	Offline, many restaurants have closed to lower costs. According to a report by the China Cuisine Association, 93 percent of catering businesses they interviewed chose to close restaurants. Of them, 73 percent have closed all their outlets, while 8 percent have closed at least 80 percent of their outlets.</p>
<p>
	Even those still open are facing tepid sales and huge financial pressure. The report said that 78 percent of the businesses have reported a loss of 100 percent during the epidemic. Though some businesses have maintained takeout services, 23 percent of them said the services could barely cover their costs.</p>
<p>
	""The epidemic simply cornered the companies and forced them to find a way out,"" said Su Jun, with the China Association of Trade in Services (CATS). ""So some are cooperating with internet platforms to get out of the mire.""</p>
<p>
	To help the companies out of trouble, CATS helped connect them with douguo.com. In the project, the catering companies provide half-prepared food materials, and their chefs present their ways of cooking. Douguo is in charge of sales, while major courier company SF Express delivers the materials to the public.</p>
<p>
	Douguo launched a special cooking channel on the app on Feb. 13, and major Chinese catering businesses have jumped on the bandwagon, including Xibei, Meizhou Dongpo and Yunhaiyao.</p>
<p>
	So far, more than 1,500 families have purchased food materials from the app. Douguo said it will invite at least 1,500 restaurant chefs to livestream themselves cooking, so that the public can learn how to pick raw materials, improve their cooking skills and study exclusive ways of making famous dishes.</p>
<p>
	""By partnering with internet food platforms, many companies have developed half-prepared materials,"" Su Jun said. ""Through the project, there is more interaction and trust between the companies and the consumers.""</p>
<p>
	Su said despite the coronavirus, he sees the companies getting through the epidemic.</p>
<p>
	""They might be experiencing winter, but spring is not far behind,"" he said.</p>

[Chinas stock exchange moves to support fight against coronavirus], 2020-02-18 10:40:23,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) stepped up efforts to support the country's fight against the coronavirus epidemic.</p>
<p>
	The SSE encouraged technological innovation enterprises related to epidemic prevention and control to be listed on China's sci-tech innovation board (STAR), according to a statement on its website.</p>
<p>
	Firms are motivated to complete roadshows through the internet and phone calls, make timely adjustments to their offering schedules and hold online listing ceremonies, said the exchange.</p>
<p>
	Noting firms' difficulties in completing auditing work and disclosing the 2019 annual report and the 2020 first-quarter report on time amid the epidemic outbreak, the exchange postponed the disclosure of annual reports for more than 70 firms and extended the time limit on mergers and acquisitions.</p>
<p>
	The SSE also granted special support to Hubei Province, waiving initial listing costs and this year's annual fee for companies from the region as well as approving the first exchange-traded fund supporting Hubei's infrastructure construction.</p>
<p>
	Enterprises from Hubei and other regions severely affected by the epidemic, as well as companies raising funds for epidemic control, are provided with direct financing and a ""green channel"" for issuance review of corporate bonds and asset-backed securities.</p>

	Li Ping (pseudonym), a mother infected with the novel coronavirus, gave birth to a healthy boy in east China's Zhejiang province on Feb. 8. As the baby boy was born on the Chinese Lantern Festival, his family gave him the nickname ""Xiao Tangyuan"" (Little Sweet Dumpling).</p>

<p>
	On the day of his birth, doctors from the hospital where “Xiao Tangyuan” was born wrote a letter to the baby: “Thank you for making us believe that all our efforts will be repaid! You gave us courage and faith to move on!”</p>
<p>
	Two days before “Xiao Tangyuan” was born, Chen Xia (pseudonym) gave birth to a baby girl in the Wuhan-based Tongji Hospital affiliated to the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, six days after she was hospitalized as a confirmed novel coronavirus patient.</p>
<p>
	On Feb. 5, Chen was 38 weeks pregnant when her temperature hit 38.5 degrees Celsius. After learning about her situation, Wu Jianli, the obstetrician, decided to immediately perform a cesarean section on her.</p>
<p>
	The C-section was also the first operation the hospital had performed after it had been designated for pregnant women infected with the novel coronavirus. To avoid infection, the doctors were put under level-three protection, the highest level of protection against the virus, during Chen’s operation.</p>
<p>
	The two babies were all immediately put under quarantine and observation at the neonatology departments after they were born.</p>
<p>
	At Tongji hospital, three newborns have been put under medical observation at a quarantine facility. If they show no symptoms, they will be released from quarantine.</p>

<p>
	Both “Xiao Tangyuan” and Chen’s daughter came back negative in their nucleic acid tests, which are needed to determine infection. Chen Ling, director of the neonatology department at Tongji Hospital, said that to avoid mother-to-child infection, it is suggested that mothers do not breastfeed their children immediately.</p>
<p>
	There was more good news to come. On Feb. 4, the first novel coronavirus-infected pregnant woman at Beijing You’an Hospital was discharged after being treated. On Feb. 5, an infected woman who was five weeks pregnant was discharged from a hospital in east China’s Zhejiang province.</p>
<p>
	Chinese governments at various levels are actively taking measures to designate hospitals with strong obstetrics and neonatal departments to provide diagnosis and treatment for pregnant women, said an official with the National Health Commission (NHC) at a news conference held by the commission on Feb. 1. </p>

[China opposes US longarm jurisdiction FM spokesperson], 2020-02-18 10:41:33,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- China firmly opposes unilateral sanctions and ""long-arm jurisdiction"" imposed by the United States citing its domestic law, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Monday.</p>
<p>
	According to the Federal Register, the United States has decided to impose sanctions on six Chinese enterprises, three Russian enterprises, one Iraqi enterprise and one Turkish enterprise in accordance with its Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act.</p>
<p>
	""China has lodged stern representations with the U.S. side,"" spokesperson Geng Shuang said during an online press briefing, adding China urges the United States to correct its mistake at once and withdraw the sanctions.</p>
<p>
	Geng said China is committed to strengthening the international non-proliferation system, strictly fulfilling the international obligation on non-proliferation and maintaining communication and cooperation with other countries on the basis of mutual respect.</p>
<p>
	By contrast, in non-proliferation and other areas, the United States has been obsessed with unilateralism and wantonly imposing unilateral sanctions and ""long-arm jurisdiction"" on others, which has been universally rejected by the international community as it severely undermines other countries' interests and international efforts in non-proliferation and safeguarding peace and stability, Geng said.</p>
<p>
	""The Iranian nuclear issue is a case in point,"" he said. ""We urge the United States to squarely face the international community's concerns and earnestly respect other countries' legitimate rights and interests.""</p>

Chinese authorities stress unremitting efforts against epidemic while resuming operation orderly, 2020-02-18 11:33:09,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese authorities on Monday called for unremitting efforts to contain the novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic while resuming business operations in an orderly fashion.</p>
<p>
	Positive results have been achieved in the prevention and control of the epidemic through great endeavor, according to a meeting of the leading group of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee on the prevention and control of the novel coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>
	Premier Li Keqiang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and also head of the aforementioned leading group, presided over the meeting.</p>
<p>
	A greater outbreak of the epidemic has been avoided through strengthened prevention and control measures, the group noted, adding that a positive trend has emerged nationwide in curbing the epidemic.</p>
<p>
	While highlighting that the epicenter of the epidemic remains in Hubei Province and its capital Wuhan, as well as complicated changes of the epidemic, the group agreed that prevention and control measures could not be loosened as most regions of the country are gradually resuming the operation of businesses and schools.</p>
<p>
	Wuhan city and Hubei Province were urged to continue to increase hospital beds and further meet the prevention and treatment demands in key areas hit by the epidemic.</p>
<p>
	In addition to more than 30,000 medics already dispatched from across China to aid Wuhan, more will be sent to Wuhan and other parts of Hubei, according to the meeting.</p>
<p>
	It now took between four and six hours for nucleic acid tests to yield results, compared with two days previously. The group decided that the test should cover all people who need to be tested.</p>
<p>
	The group called for an orderly resumption of business operations and production, the avoidance of unnecessary personnel gathering, and assistance to enterprises in solving their problems in terms of raw materials and funds.</p>
<p>
	Wang Huning, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and deputy head of the leading group, attended the meeting.</p>

[Coronavirus A threat not an opportunity to blame bash contain and defame China], 2020-02-18 11:16:49,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	One man’s gain is another man’s loss. At least this is the philosophy that Wilbur Ross, who also happens to be the US Commerce Secretary, adheres to. His statements are not in harmony with those of US President Donald Trump, who emphasized he would continue extensive communication and cooperation between the US and China in a phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>
	The WHO has already declared the Covid-19 outbreak a global threat, as it has been detected in a couple of dozen countries. While the epicenter of the outbreak is in Wuhan, and most of those infected are in the Chinese province of Hubei, the world must work together relentlessly in order to contain the epidemic worldwide.</p>
<p>
	In times of crisis and viral epidemics, the world must engage in even closer cooperation. In general, the international reaction has been positive, with a few exceptions, of course. The World Health Organization (WHO) praised China’s efforts to contain the new disease, saying they have ""bought the world valuable time"" and that other nations must make the most of it. Responsible countries have treated it as a natural disaster and are standing with China in this difficult time, extending all possible moral, diplomatic, political and material support, such as the donation of medical equipment and sending medical staff.</p>
<p>
	But some of the more opportunistic nations have seen it as a chance to blame, bash, contain, and defame China. US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross has said the coronavirus outbreak in China could be positive for the American economy. His statement is based on the philosophy of “Your loss is my gain”, unlike the Chinese thinking, which encourages win-win partnerships. Famous German magazine Der Spiegel ran a front-page report over the weekend featuring an Asian wearing red protective clothing, goggles, and headphones, with the headline ""Made in China."" This highly racist and provocative publication was not expected from a civilized nation like Germany. Denmark's Jyllands-Posten printed a cartoon of the Chinese flag with virus-like figures in place of the symbolic Golden-Yellow stars. It should be remembered that these acts set bad precedents, and do not help with the global epidemic fight.</p>
<p>
	<strong>President Xi: On the frontline</strong></p>
<p>
	At the 12th meeting of the Communist Party of China (CPC) central committee for deepening overall reforms, held on 14th February 2020, President Xi stressed improving the mechanisms for major epidemic prevention and control and the national public health emergency management system. He further emphasized strengthening legislation on public health and assessment of revising laws and regulations concerning infectious disease prevention and treatment.</p>
<p>
	Under President Xi’s leadership, China is working on a war footing and in unison to defeat the epidemic. The first priority is to confine the virus to a limited area and isolate the infected people so as to control its further spread. Simultaneously, scientists are developing a vaccine against Covid-19. Development of vaccines and its testing on animals and then human trials is a time-consuming process. The state is fully aware and strict legislation and policies are being formulated and implemented to prevent similar outbreaks in the future. Chinese intellectuals have the capacity to formulate a strong policy framework to deal with future disasters too. Formulating relevant laws is easier than their implementation. The strength of the Chinese governance system is that it can effectively implement the policies in their true spirit.</p>
<p>
	The number of those infected has reached 70,548, with 1,770 deaths by Feb.16. This number may have increased by the time you read this article. But due to its enormous political will and economic strength, we are confident that the leadership and governance system of China will be able to overcome the epidemic soon enough. </p>

China strengthens online science popularization amid epidemic, 2020-02-18 09:48:04,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	SHANGHAI, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- Science and technology popularization institutes across China jointly launched an online science popularization campaign Monday to help fight against the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic.</p>
<p>
	The campaign includes quizzes on COVID-19 related knowledge in the aspects such as virology, clinical medicine, epidemiology, preventive medicine and policies and regulations on epidemic control. Quizzes on other infectious diseases such as SARS and Ebola and the conservation of biodiversity are also included.</p>
<p>
	The campaign is led by organizations including China Science and Technology Museum, Shanghai Science and Technology Museum, and the Beijing Museum of Natural History, and jointly hosted by 150 science and technology organizations.</p>
<p>
	Netizens can log on to the website of the campaign, answer the quizzes from Feb. 17 to 28, and win prizes, including entrance tickets to museums, tickets for science popularization movies and souvenirs from these venues.</p>
<p>
	""Some of my relatives and friends felt worried and confused about the novel coronavirus. The online campaign provides an interesting way to help us understand the basic knowledge about the epidemic and how to contain it,"" said Zhou Qi, a 30-year-old netizen.</p>
<p>
	""To me, the precise information about the epidemic and advice to protect us from it would be the best prize,"" she said.</p>
<p>
	A few museums in the Yangtze Delta River area launched the first round of online science popularization quizzes campaign since early February, attracting over 30,000 netizens participating within two weeks, said Gu Qingsheng, deputy director-general of Shanghai Science and Technology Museum.</p>
<p>
	According to Gu, the development of epidemic control and precise knowledge to contain the epidemic are people's top concerns now.</p>
<p>
	As the domain quiz-designer, the Shanghai Natural History Museum, a branch of Shanghai Science and Technology Museum, published the analysis on easy-to-get-wrong quizzes on its WeChat public account.</p>
<p>
	""Judging from the results of the first round of the quiz, we found that the majority of respondents have basic knowledge about the epidemic, but they still need more information on wildlife animal protection and the latest policies to contain the epidemic,"" said Gu Jieyan, deputy director of the Shanghai Natural History Museum Management Committee.</p>
<p>
	Museums and science venues across China have strengthened online science popularization by maintaining online exhibitions and increasing science popularization programs on the internet since the epidemic outbreak.</p>
<p>
	""Though museums and venues are temporarily shut down, we will never stop science popularization, that's why the online quiz campaign has broadened across China,"" Gu Qingsheng said. ""We're planning to launch online live programs to make sure audiences can enjoy the museum at home.""</p>
<p>
	""With the latest technologies, science and technology venues can broadcast their latest research outcomes and knowledge to the public in a timely manner, which is a new trend in recent years,"" according to Gu Qingsheng.</p>
<p>
	""I believe online science popularization will have greater development in the future,"" he said.</p>

[2monthold girl infected with novel coronavirus discharged from hospital], 2020-02-18 10:02:10,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	GUANGZHOU, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- A 2-month-old girl diagnosed with the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was discharged from hospital on Monday afternoon after recovery in south China's Guangdong Province.</p>
<p>
	The baby and her family from Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic outbreak, arrived at the city of Chaozhou by car to visit their relatives on Jan. 25. After quarantining themselves in a hotel, the family, including the baby's elder brother and grandmother, developed symptoms one by one and were all confirmed to be infected with the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>
	The little girl, who developed a hoarse voice on Feb. 3, tested positive the next day and was transferred from a local hospital to the Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center.</p>
<p>
	She was later diagnosed with pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus, according to the center.</p>
<p>
	After 13 days of treatment, she tested negative twice for the novel coronavirus and was discharged from the center.</p>
<p>
	As her family members are still receiving treatment or under quarantine, she has been sent to a welfare home in Chaozhou City before a second examination scheduled in 14 days at the center.</p>
<p>
	The baby was the youngest person diagnosed with COVID-19 to be cured in Guangdong Province.</p>
<p>
	To take care of the baby around the clock, the center sent four additional nurses to the isolation ward as her ""nanny moms,"" said Sun Jing, head nurse of the center's isolation ward.</p>
<p>
	Peng Fenxia was one of her ""moms.""</p>
<p>
	Peng, also a mother, liked chatting with the baby, even though the ""conversation"" was carried out all by herself. She also prepared a rattle for the little girl.</p>
<p>
	""Although simple actions like holding the baby needed extra strength while wearing the protective gear, I felt very soothed seeing her smile,"" she said.</p>
<p>
	Peng recalled the baby had become used to having the nurses in white protective suits around after days of treatment.</p>
<p>
	""She would smile at us when seeing us. She liked eye contact and also liked us holding her when she cried,"" Peng said.</p>
<p>
	Inside the baby's swaddling clothes, Peng found a note saying, ""The baby is my life. If you save her, you'll be my lifesaver.""</p>
<p>
	The nurses kept the note as a commitment to the mother they had never met.</p>
<p>
	""I'm delighted that we have kept our commitment,"" Peng said.</p>

Number of infections on cruise rises to 454, 2020-02-18 09:44:47,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	<img alt="""" src=""http://www.people.com.cn/mediafile/pic/default.jpg"">The Japanese government confirmed on Monday 99 more people on board the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise liner were infected with novel coronavirus pneumonia, bringing the total to 454.</p>
<p>
	Of the 99 people — 85 passengers and 14 crew members — who tested positive on Monday, 19 were seriously ill, according to Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.</p>
<p>
	The ministry said 43 of the infected people were Japanese, and the nationalities of the others were still to be confirmed.</p>
<p>
	“Although measures are being taken to prevent infection on board, the infection control may not be successful, and it is necessary to quickly analyze why the number of infected people is increasing,” the ministry said.</p>
<p>
	Some 3,700 passengers and crew on board the cruise ship have been kept in quarantine since early February after the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia.</p>
<p>
	Monday’s update brought the total number of cases on board the vessel to 454, the largest confirmed cluster anywhere outside China. A number of countries, including the United States, Canada and Italy, are removing their citizens from the ship.</p>
<p>
	The US organized two charter flights to evacuate more than 300 people on Monday. The US State Department later announced that 14 of the evacuees were infected with the virus.</p>
<p>
	China’s Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government will arrange two chartered flights to bring back its more than 300 residents on the vessel, an official said Monday.</p>
<p>
	John Lee Ka-chiu, secretary for security of the SAR government, said at a news briefing that the government will ask the Japanese authority to transport them to Haneda Airport in Tokyo to get on the chartered flights.</p>
<p>
	The two flights will bring the Hong Kong residents back on Thursday, Lee said, adding that there will be a 14-day quarantine period upon their arrival.</p>
<p>
	Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said that his country will send a plane to Japan to bring home 35 Italians on board.</p>
<p>
	Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Monday that China is closely following the situation in Japan.</p>
<p>
	“The virus knows no borders, but the worst of times reveals the best of people,” he said during an online news conference, calling on the international community to step up cooperation and jointly tackle the challenge.</p>
<p>
	Noting that the Japanese government and people from all walks of life in Japan have so far offered sincere support and assistance to China, Geng said China will never forget it and that he wished to express its heartfelt thanks.</p>
<p>
	The spokesman said that China stands ready to share information and experience with Japan and offer support and assistance in accordance with its needs.</p>

Digital maps help China track people flows amid epidemic, 2020-02-18 10:11:56,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- Digital maps have become a key part of China's prevention and control of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as people gradually return to their cities of residence after an extended holiday.</p>
<p>
	Local governments are cooperating with mapping service providers to trace the passenger flows in cities and take prevention measures based on the data.</p>
<p>
	A big data platform developed by Baidu Map updates the population flow data of more than 300 cities every day, including where the passengers come and go, each city's migration scale and trend, as well as urban travel intensity, providing comprehensive information of population flow for the public, media, government and scientific research.</p>
<p>
	The platform shows that the overall scale of the post-holiday travel rush has dropped significantly compared to previous years.</p>
<p>
	From the first day of the Lunar New Year to Sunday, the average congestion distance on expressways decreased by 86.6 percent nationwide and the passenger flow in transportation hubs was only 35.6 percent of the same period last year.</p>
<p>
	However, Xu Yahua, an official with the Ministry of Transport, warned that passenger transport is returning to normal levels as people start returning to work.</p>
<p>
	The comparison of population flow before and after the holiday shows that there are still a large number of people who have yet to return to their work cities.</p>
<p>
	The country's biggest cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen will be the hottest destinations for passenger inflow in the following weeks, according to the big data platform.</p>
<p>
	Local governments can pay close attention to the latest data of population flow on the platform to make sufficient preparations for epidemic prevention and control, said Li Ying, vice president of Baidu and general manager of Baidu Map.</p>
<p>
	A voice broadcast function to inform drivers of epidemic checks has been launched on the Baidu Map app in a dozen cities.</p>
<p>
	Traffic police can mark the location of epidemic checkpoints on the platform and app users will hear the voice prompt set by the police when nearing the checkpoints.</p>
<p>
	Citizens can also use the map app to check whether there were once COVID-19 patients on the vehicles they took or in the places they have been to, in order to confirm whether they are at risk of infection.</p>
<p>
	Another leading Chinese mapping service provider AutoNavi has opened an online function to the public to detail the passenger flows of the Beijing subway.</p>
<p>
	Citizens can open the updated AutoNavi app and check whether different subway stations are crowded. The passenger flow density is graded with the colors red, yellow and green.</p>
<p>
	The subway passenger flow data of the app is provided by the Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport.</p>
<p>
	Li Meng, a researcher from Tsinghua University, suggested that traffic departments better cooperate with tech firms to provide citizens with the latest public traffic information.</p>
<p>
	Auto Navi said it is willing to provide the service to more traffic departments of other cities.</p>

[Chinas focus now on reviving economy seeking balance between virus controls work resumption], 2020-02-18 10:19:38,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0218/FOREIGN202002181019000537782448413.jpeg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 300px;""></p>
<p>
	<em>A worker of HBIS Group Tangsteel Company patrols at the steel coil storage area in Tangshan, north China's Hebei Province, May 31, 2019. (Xinhua/Mu Yu)</em></p>
<p>
	With growing signs that the COVID-19 outbreak is being tamed, the focus is now on broad-based efforts to steady the Chinese economy, market watchers said, highlighting the debate about a balance between epidemic controls and the restart of economic activity, and between policy support and the risk of over-stimulating the economy.</p>
<p>
	New confirmed infections outside Central China's Hubei Province, the epicenter of the novel coronavirus pneumonia, fell for the 13th day in a row as of Sunday, according to figures released by the National Health Commission on Monday.</p>
<p>
	In another sign, the daily number of patients discharged from hospitals in Hubei for the first time topped 1,000 on Sunday. Along with easing virus fears come calls for measures to revive the virus-battered economy.</p>
<p>
	On the micro level, industries and businesses have spared no effort to restore activity. A notable example is Haidilao, one of the country's most popular hotpot chains, that has announced that both its physical stores and food delivery services have resumed operations.</p>
<p>
	Still, analysts ask for due attention to be given to contentious pro-growth efforts.</p>
<p>
	""I personally reckon that what's most needed now is not [the push to] stimulate the economy, but to get the economy back on track in an orderly manner,"" Wu Jinduo, head of fixed income at the research institute of Great Wall Securities, told the Global Times on Monday.</p>
<p>
	Other than Hubei, the nation's 30 provincial-level regions have all arranged for companies to resume work and production, Chen Da, an official with the National Development and Reform Commission, said on February 9 at a press conference of the joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council on Sunday.</p>
<p>
	The joint prevention and control mechanism also put up a notice earlier this month calling for enhanced efforts to scientifically prevent and contain the virus while handling the restart of work and production well.</p>
<p>
	The regions outside of Hubei that have large populations but are less hit by the disease bear an unshakable responsibility for the orderly restart of work and production, Wu suggested.</p>
<p>
	She pointed out that it's not easy to handle the balance between epidemic controls and the resumption of work on the side of local governments and businesses, especially the latter, which are under great pressure to be mindful of potential faults in recommencing operation.</p>
<p>
	Some local governments and businesses appear to have gone too far in putting virus prevention on top of the push to restart activity, Wu stressed, calling for relevant authorities to be held responsible for formalism that weighs on the revival of the economy.</p>
<p>
	Another point of contention is expectations over more fiscal support and monetary easing that stoked concerns over rising leverage and their spillover effects on the property market.</p>
<p>
	The People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, lowered the interest rate on one-year medium-term lending facility (MLF) loans worth 200 billion yuan ($28.65 billion) by 10 basis points to 3.15 percent.</p>
<p>
	Expecting a cut of 10 basis points in the benchmark loan prime rate around the corner, Lu Zhengwei, chief economist at Industrial Bank in Shanghai, said that while some regions have announced plans to allow delayed payments for land transfers, home prices are still expected to be reined in.</p>
<p>
	As Wu put it, signs of property easing in some areas might only be an expedient move to respond to the downward pressure on local economies amid the virus outbreak. Nationwide, it will still be the case that housing is for living in instead of speculation.</p>

[Traditional Chinese medicine effective in COVID19 treatment official], 2020-02-18 10:21:44,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been proven effective in curing patients of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a Chinese health official said Monday.</p>
<p>
	For example, a TCM decoction named ""Qingfei Paidutang"" has been used in treating 701 confirmed cases in 10 provinces, of which 130 have been cured and discharged, said Li Yu, an official with the National Administration of TCM.</p>
<p>
	Symptoms have disappeared in 51 cases and improved in 268, with another 212 remaining in stable condition, said Li, adding that the decoction was recommended to medical institutions nationwide on Feb. 6 after data analysis on 214 cases.</p>
<p>
	Li also shared the analysis and statistics cases with detailed clinical records, as 94.6 percent of the 112 patients restored to normal body temperature, and 80.6 percent of 214 patients stopped coughing after using the decoction for six days.</p>
<p>
	The data showed the decoction's good clinical effect and treatment prospect on COVID-19, said Li.</p>
<p>
	The central government's joint prevention and control mechanism on the situation has called for stronger cooperation between TCM and Western medicine in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases such as COVID-19, requiring local authorities to promote the use of TCM in the whole process of diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>
	As of Monday, more than 3,100 medical personnel from over 630 TCM hospitals across the country have been sent to aid Hubei Province in the fight against the epidemic, said Jiang Jian, another official of the national administration.</p>
<p>
	TCM has been used in treating 60,107 confirmed cases in China, or 85.2 percent of the total, according to Jiang.</p>

Government assists grads seeking work, 2020-02-18 09:12:58,"<div class=""wb_12 clear"">

	<em>Candidates look at employment opportunities at a job fair in Nanjing, Jiangsu province. [Photo by Liu Jianhua/For China Daily]</em></p>
<p>
	<strong>Job fairs around country are closed to help contain spread of coronavirus</strong></p>
<p>
	The central government is making efforts to relieve employment pressure on college graduates as large-scale job fairs are suspended or canceled to contain the novel coronavirus pneumonia.</p>
<p>
	Wang Hui, director of the college students department of the Ministry of Education, said at a news conference recently that the number of graduates will reach 8.74 million this year, 400,000 higher than in 2019.</p>
<p>
	At a time when these graduates were supposed to be busy looking for jobs, they are facing a hard situation due to the epidemic nationwide. Large gatherings have been banned, including job fairs.</p>
<p>
	The effect of an already slowing economy on businesses has been overlapped by new economic losses brought by the epidemic, leading many companies to raise the bar for college graduates and reduce recruitment quotas to control labor costs.</p>
<p>
	Zhaopin, an online recruitment agency in Beijing, released a report in early February saying that positions offered on its platform decreased 71.6 percent year-on-year in the first week after the Spring Festival holiday.</p>
<p>
	About 30.4 percent of surveyed companies said that they will consider cutting down their recruitment quotas because of the epidemic. Another 30 percent said they can't pay salaries on time.</p>
<p>
	According to the report, half of the surveyed companies will limit their recruitment quota to 10 people while only about 25 percent of them will recruit 30 or more people.</p>
<p>
	To reduce the impact of the epidemic as much as possible, the Ministry of Education is stepping up online employment services for college students and helping develop more job opportunities to relieve their pressure, Wang said.</p>
<p>
	""The ministry will maintain close connections with provincial-level recruitment platforms and those run by companies to share employment information with them, and make the information more accessible to students,"" he said.""Universities are encouraged to offer services like interviews or contract signing online.""</p>
<p>
	The ministry is also endeavoring to develop more job opportunities, and is encouraging graduates to serve on the grassroots level, join the army or start their own businesses.</p>
<p>
	Graduates in poor financial condition will have designated college staff members help them to get employment information.</p>
<p>
	Seeking jobs or doing interviews online is strongly recommended by the government amid the epidemic. On Feb 5, five central government departments including the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Transport jointly released a notice encouraging universities and companies to organize recruitment tests and interviews online.</p>
<p>
	Recruitment campaigns will be lengthened and employment services－for example, signing employment contracts－will be open to college students online, the notice said.</p>
<p>
	Zhaopin suggested that it is better for graduates to take action as early as possible, like sending their resumes online.</p>
<p>
	College students should also adjust their targets while remaining confident in themselves because job markets may be affected by the epidemic for some time but will soon resume, it said.</p>
<p>
	Li Zeming from Qufu Normal University in Shandong province will be admitted to the university as a teacher after he gets his doctoral degree in June.</p>
<p>
	""I should get a paper published before graduating from the university, then deal with work matters,"" he said.""The epidemic makes me face problems sending my paper to publishing units, which will affect my graduation. If I can't publish the paper before June, my graduation will be postponed to December.""</p>
<p>
	He said he is much luckier than his peers because he had already settled the job with the university.</p>
<p>
	""All I'm worried about is the paper－I'm not sure when will it be published. But most of my friends who haven't gotten job offers yet are anxious about their future jobs.""</p>

[Povertystricken county leaves no student behind], 2020-02-18 09:10:43,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	CHANGSHA, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- Dai Fa, 26, could have been a folk musician, but he stepped off the stage and chose to teach in his mountainous hometown.</p>
<p>
	Dai is a music teacher of a middle school in Luxi, a county in central China's Hunan Province with 62.3 percent of the ethnic minority population. It is one of the 11 national-level deep poverty-stricken counties in the province.</p>
<p>
	Like many remote areas, Luxi saw an outflow of talent, who are attracted by the opportunities in cities. The local education faced a grave situation with teachers leaving and young talent reluctant to come.</p>
<p>
	As a Luxi native, Dai had never planned to return to his hometown before graduating from university.</p>
<p>
	""When I was a child, the development of education in my hometown was lagging behind,"" Dai said. The poverty and lack of educational resources in Luxi made him eager to leave there and earn a living in big cities.</p>
<p>
	After graduating from the Tianjin Conservatory of Music in 2018, he got a job as an erhu (a traditional Chinese instrument) performer in a song and dance troupe in Hunan.</p>
<p>
	Tan Zihao, director of Luxi's education bureau, watched one of Dai's performances and was deeply impressed. After many attempts, Tan later managed to persuade Dai to return to Luxi to help develop the local education.</p>
<p>
	Many of Dai's students had only seen an erhu and cello that he brought to the school on TV before, and they were very excited to learn how to play them.</p>
<p>
	""The spark in their eyes reminded me of myself in the high school,"" Dai said.</p>
<p>
	""The faculty is the key to education. Only by keeping them can we help more people get out of the mountains, broaden their horizons to develop local industries, and eradicate poverty from the roots,"" said Du Xiaoyong, the county's Party chief.</p>
<p>
	To balance teaching resources between urban and rural areas, Luxi established a mechanism to award and select academic leaders in favor of rural teachers and encourage urban teachers to work in rural schools.</p>
<p>
	The local government also offers the teachers monthly subsidies as well as free apartments or low-rent housing.</p>
<p>
	To ensure that education reaches even the most remote villages, the county has set up ""teaching sites,"" schools with few teachers and students, in almost all the villages in the county.</p>
<p>
	""As long as there is one student, there will be a teacher there,"" Tan, the education official, said.</p>
<p>
	Yang Shuqing, the only teacher in a school at Dengyun village of Heshui Town, has been working there for 10 years. At present, there are 15 preschool students, three first-graders and four second-graders.</p>
<p>
	The students from two villages in a nearby county also come to the school because of the good campus environment and teaching quality.</p>
<p>
	""Although they are far away from the county, my students never score below 80 out of 100 on a test,"" said Yang. ""As a teacher, this is my greatest pride.""</p>
<p>
	To show their gratitude, the students often bring her homemade food and specialties, Yang said, adding that the recognition from students and parents is the most valuable gift.</p>
<p>
	""In the past, my dream was to shine on the stage, now my dream is to let more children leave the mountains and embrace a better future,"" Dai said.</p>

        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- China has dispatched more than 30,000 medical staff, including elite medical groups, to assist in the fight against the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in the epicenter Wuhan, Guo Yanhong, an official with the National Health Commission (NHC), said Monday.</p>

[Cao Dewang on American Factory Im not worried about negative impact], 2020-02-18 09:22:46,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	Last August, the documentary ""American Factory"" was released in the United States, telling the story of Chinese company Fuyao Glass Co. Ltd. and its bid to set up a factory there. On Feb. 9, 2020, the film won the award for best documentary feature at the 92nd Academy Awards ceremony, making Cao Dewang, chairman of Fuyao Glass and his company go viral on the Internet.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0218/FOREIGN202002180925000358161717275.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 332px;""></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<em>Cao Dewang (Photo/People's Daily Online)</em></p>
<p>
	""There are criticisms about me in this documentary, but I'm not worried about the negative impact,"" Cao Dewang said in comments about ""American Factory"" to the People's Daily online.</p>
<p>
	In the view of many netizens, ""American Factory"" has a lot of criticisms about Cao Dewang, founder of Fuyao Glass, which is ""not necessarily a good thing"" for the company. </p>
<p>
	In an exclusive interview with a reporter from People's Daily online, Cao Dewang was open about his portrayal. </p>
<p>
	“A lot of documentaries themselves are critical in nature, because they want to be true, 100 percent true, with no literary creation. When I asked him (the director) to do the shooting, a lot of people were surprised and thought they would 'die' because of this. I told him (the director) that whatever I do, he can shoot whatever he saw.”</p>
<p>
	During the four and a half years of filming, Cao Dewang and his factory made everything public with no reservations. Many people wonder why Cao Dewang was willing to ""take such risks"". </p>
<p>
	""When I went to invest in the United States, Americans did not believe that the landing of such a large project was done by a private Chinese enterprise, including the contractors who contracted the project,” said Cao, adding that “I think, instead of letting them secretly inquire and peek, it is better for people to film and spread it. Later, they finally believed that Fuyao could do it. ""</p>
<p>
	Two days before the release of ""American Factory"" in the United States on Aug. 21, 2019, Cao Dewang had an advance viewing of the film. Fuyao's management staff, who watched the documentary with him, were worried that it would lead to controversy.</p>
<p>
	But Cao Dewang had no such concerns. ""I told the director that there is no need to change anything. As long as it does not cause any legal disputes, you can broadcast it as you like.""</p>
<p>
	Cao Dewang's calm comes from his confidence in Fuyao Glass and its workers. </p>
<p>
	In one scene from the documentary, Cao Dewang walks into the factory conference room and says to the Chinese workers sitting below, ""I hope your performance will change the way Americans think about China.""</p>
<p>
	""Do you think they have achieved this?"" Cao Dewang did not answer the reporter's question directly, but his words revealed ""satisfaction."" </p>
<p>
	""At that time, about 200 employees went to the United States for this project, and I told them that practical actions should be taken to demonstrate the hard-working values and patriotism of the Chinese people. In the film, we can see the Chinese staff are outstanding. I am very grateful to them. ""</p>
<p>
	He said that Chinese workers can endure hardships and are very dedicated to their work. ""China is what it is today. There is one thing in China that is absolutely better than anywhere else, that is, a uniform pace, which only the Chinese can perform. ""</p>
<p>
	Fuyao’s factory in the US holds an open day every week for the locals, and Cao Dewang hopes to allow more Americans to enter this modern and ""beautiful"" Chinese factory.</p>
<p>
	""Many Americans have never been to China. They don't have to travel a long distance. They can visit the Fuyao factory directly in the United States. My original intention is to show Americans that Chinese enterprises are not like 'labor camps' as they imagine, but automated and modern factories. "" </p>

[Chinas Huawei to make more contribution in 2020 to ICT capacity building in Ethiopia], 2020-02-18 09:41:44,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	ADDIS ABABA, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- China's tech giant Huawei has planned to enhance its contribution to capacity building for Ethiopians in the information and communication technologies (ICT) sector this year, targeting increased number of beneficiaries.</p>
<p>
	The Huawei Ethiopia CEO, Zhou Tianbing, told Xinhua on Monday that Huawei will continue its activities helping the East African country improve education development with most advanced technologies, with committed efforts to bridge the digital divide for Ethiopians.</p>
<p>
	Huawei has launched and been implementing different initiatives to improve the ICT capacity of young people in Ethiopia, in particular, and Africa in general.</p>
<p>
	""With a view of building ICT capacity and further improve ICT development, Huawei has launched three major initiatives dubbed Seeds for the Future, ICT competition, and ICT Talent Ecosystem, and these projects have benefited tens of thousands of students at the levels of elementary, secondary and higher education.""Zhou said.</p>
<p>
	Recalling that Huawei commenced its Seeds for Future project in Ethiopia in 2016, whereby 10 most talented students are sent to China every year for short-term training, the CEO said Huawei, in cooperation with the Ethiopian Ministry of Science and Higher Education (MoSHE), would continue to select 10 students from top universities across the country.</p>
<p>
	Huawei, since 2018, has been undertaking its project of ICT Competition, in which 2,357 students from 22 universities of Ethiopia participated in the year 2019, with increased number of participants, which was a little more than 500 in 2018. And one teacher and three students have been qualified for the final competition to be held in China.</p>
<p>
	In 2020, Huawei has targeted to engage more than 3,000 students from 28 universities to show their talents in the ICT competition.</p>
<p>
	On the ICT Talent Ecosystem of Ethiopia, Huawei signed an agreement with MoSHE in January 2017 for joint construction of ICT Academies in 37 public higher education institutions.</p>
<p>
	The two sides also signed agreement in January 2019 to jointly construct ICT Academies in technical and vocational education and training (TVET), the first time in Ethiopia to extend Huawei Academy to TVET.</p>
<p>
	Huawei has launched courses in more than 20 universities and TVETs, and has trained more than 1,500 ICT students.</p>
<p>
	With the initiative of ICT Academy, Huawei has a plan to open courses this year in nine more universities and three more TVETs in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>
	Reiterating that Huawei Ethiopia attaches great importance to helping the country improve education development with more advanced ICT, Zhou said his company would further strengthen its support in the year 2020.</p>
<p>
	In 2015, Huawei worked with 65 schools in Ethiopia for the implementation of SchoolNet by deploying 5,200 cloud desktops in the schools. In 2017, Huawei SchoolNet Education Cloud has deployed 25,000 cloud desktops for a total of 310 schools in 9 regions and 2 cities of the country.</p>
<p>
	By now, Huawei's Education Cloud Solution has covered 365 secondary schools, 10 universities, with more than 30,000 cloud desktops, which have benefited more than 27,000 teachers and students, according to the CEO.</p>
<p>
	Huawei has also worked together with more than 10 top universities in Ethiopia, where it has constructed the most advanced datacenters, fixed &amp; wireless school networks and Education Cloud for them.</p>
<p>
	So far, more than 300,000 college students have become beneficiaries of digital research and development, digital education and distant education empowered by Huawei, he said.</p>

<p>
	The first child diagnosed with critical COVID-19 in the Chinese mainland has recovered and was allowed to leave Wuhan Children's Hospital on Feb. 13.</p>
<p>
	Niuniu, the 1-year-old boy, suffered from occasional diarrhea and vomiting, as well as fever, and was sent to the hospital on Jan. 26.</p>
<p>
	His oxygen saturation was only 80 percent of the normal rate when he was admitted to the ICU.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0217/FOREIGN202002171810000566819801147.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 543px;""></p>
<p>
	Zhang Furong, chief physician at Wuhan Children's Hospital's Intensive Care Department, along with her medical team took charge of Niuniu’s case.</p>
<p>
	Zhang said that the boy's nucleic acid test showed a positive result, and that he was the first child patient diagnosed with severe COVID-19 in Chinese mainland.</p>
<p>
	The medical team treated Niuniu using methods such as continuous blood purification and tried to stabilize his condition by using medication that helped improve his immunity and nutritional levels.</p>
<p>
	After receiving treatment and care from medical staff, the boy's condition gradually improved and he was successfully taken off the medical ventilator and intubation on Feb. 6.</p>
<p>
	After two more negative nucleic acid test results, Niuniu was confirmed negative and he was allowed to leave the hospital.</p>
<p>
	“Judging from the current diagnosis and treatment experience, most children with infection are of the common type, and there are not many children diagnosed with the disease,” said Zhang, “There is no need for parents to panic.”</p>
<p>
	Zhang said COVID-19 mainly manifests itself through severe respiratory symptoms and high fever. Any child with such symptoms should go to hospital immediately, she said.</p>

	<strong>Monday's proposals to postpone China's ""two sessions"" conform to the reality that China has entered the most crucial stage of fighting the novel coronavirus epidemic and must prevent any risks of rendering the previous sacrifices of the entire nation in vain.</strong></p>
<p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- The proposals to postpone China's ""two sessions,"" a key event in the country's political calendar, came out Monday in a timely and responsible manner, as the latest evidence that China is trying its best to buy time for the world to contain the outbreak of novel coronavirus or COVID-19.</p>
<p>
	The openings of the annual sessions of the National People's Congress, China's highest organ of state power, and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, China's top political advisory body, had been held on March 5 and March 3, respectively, since 1998.</p>
<p>
	Monday's proposals conform to the reality that China has entered the most crucial stage of fighting the novel coronavirus epidemic and must prevent any risks of rendering the previous sacrifices of the entire nation in vain.</p>
<p>
	Through arduous efforts, the epidemic overall is generally under control. Outside the hardest-hit Hubei Province, the number of confirmed cases had been declining for 13 consecutive days across China by Sunday. China contains 99 percent of COVID-19 cases within its borders.</p>

<p>
	Among nearly 3,000 national lawmakers and more than 2,000 political advisors, many of them are fighting at the frontlines. Any lax efforts at this time will cause huge losses, both for China and the world.</p>
<p>
	The announcement demonstrates a responsible and transparent attitude toward epidemic control work. The proposals will gain wide public endorsement and boost national confidence.</p>
<p>
	By postponing the sessions to an appropriate time, decision-makers will have more time to examine the current situation and roll out measures more precisely and effectively to restore normal economic and social activity.</p>
<p>
	At the two sessions, national lawmakers and political advisors are expected to review and discuss a series of work reports which cover every aspect of China's development and the people's wellbeing. Growth targets and reform goals need to be set. Budgets, development plans and laws need to be reviewed and put to vote.</p>
<p>
	All these should be done on the basis of full awareness about the virus, what the impacts are, how to minimize them and boost development accordingly. The decisions and measures will also be significant to the world as China contributes nearly one-third of global economic growth.</p>
<p>
	China has given its top priority to ensure the safety and health of the Chinese people and has created a window of opportunity for other countries to intensify preparedness.</p>
<p>
	The window is still open and the best way to make up for the loss is to tackle the epidemic with speed, determination and unity. </p>

Portuguese electricity company sends medical supplies to China, 2020-02-17 16:04:34,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	Over 200,000 medical articles have recently been sent from Porto, Portugal by plane to Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, which will then be transported to Wuhan, the epicenter of the novel coronavirus outbreak, as requested by Energias de Portugal (EDP), a Portuguese electric utilities company and the donator of the supplies.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0217/FOREIGN202002171606000403885072093.jpeg"" style=""width: 400px; height: 421px;""></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<em>Medical supplies are packed before transportation (Photo via the CTG)</em></p>
<p>
	Specifically, the batch of medical supplies includes 45,000 masks, 420 items of protective clothing, 15,000 surgical gowns, 40,000 medical caps and 100,000 pairs of disposable shoe covers.</p>
<p>
	“We’ve decided to donate medical supplies as we’ve learnt that Wuhan is severely lacking medical items,” said António Mexia, CEO of EDP.</p>
<p>
	In order to gather as many as medical supplies as possible, Mexia got in touch with over 20 suppliers around the world and managed to procure over 200,000 medical items in about one week.</p>
<p>
	The batch of medical supplies will be transported to Wuhan by China Three Gorges Corporation (CTG), a strategic partner of EDP.</p>
<p>
	According to Mexia, the pneumonia outbreak will not affect the cooperation between EDP and CTG. “In fact, we hope to deepen the bilateral cooperation and explore third-party markets together,” said Mexia.</p>
<p>
	The CTG now holds 23.3 percent of the shares in the EDP and has maintained friendly cooperation with EDP for over eight years.</p>
<p>
	Mexia is optimistic about China’s final victory over the coronavirus. “The Chinese people are strong and efficient, and are able to overcome the adversity,” he said.</p>

Blockchain technology improves coronavirus response, 2020-02-17 17:01:51,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) - It's a classic contradiction of public versus personal interests: how can authorities slow the spread of coronavirus while protecting patient privacy?</p>
<p>
	How can you cut the transmission chain while protecting personal information?</p>
<p>
	How do you maintain transparency from the loading of donated supplies to the final use by people who need them most?</p>
<p>
	Blockchain technology - using encrypted data and records to track transactions - has been helping Chinese government and medical agencies in the battle against the novel coronavirus without compromising privacy.</p>
<p>
	From Feb. 1 to 14, at least 20 applications based on blockchain were launched to tackle the emerging challenges.</p>
<p>
	Personal information management is a major area of blockchain application. As more people return to work this month, apps and platforms based on ID information are being launched.</p>
<p>
	In Xi'an, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, a system for online consultation and screening was launched on Feb. 1. The blockchain system securely manages health records, ensuring interoperability without compromising security and patient privacy.</p>
<p>
	In Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, Vastchain Technology introduced Access Pass, a mini program on WeChat that can generate QR codes to enable residents to enter gated communities.</p>
<p>
	According to the company, all personal information collected is encrypted and stored in blockchain-based cloud servers. Even the company cannot retrieve the original data and it will eliminate all the data publicly after the epidemic is over.</p>
<p>
	With the spread of the novel coronavirus, the management, allocation and donation of relief supplies have been a challenge. Payment platform Alipay launched an information platform on its mobile app to enable collaboration with transparency and efficiency.</p>
<p>
	Led by the Zhejiang Provincial Health Commission and the Economy and Information Technology Department, the blockchain-based platform enables the review, recording and tracking of demand, supplies and logistics of epidemic prevention materials.</p>
<p>
	Supplies involve multiple parties from donors and recipients to delivery and warehousing. Alipay said the entire process of record and verification by each party is tamper-proof, enabling anyone to track the process.</p>
<p>
	Blockchain technology was also applied in the official daily updates about the epidemic in Jinan, Shandong Province.</p>
<p>
	Local authorities say blockchain makes information on the platform tamper-proof and traceable. It achieves precise collection of epidemic data and dispels rumors, helping citizens to cope with the epidemic in a positive and reasonable way.</p>

	<em>Photo taken on April 6, 2018 shows the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in Beijing, capital of China. (Xinhua/Li He)</em></p>
<p>
	<strong>""Facts have proven once again that as the largest state actor of spying in cyberspace, the U.S. is worthy of the name of the 'empire of hackers.' The sky is the limit with the U.S. when it comes to spying,"" said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang.</strong></p>
<p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- Facts have proven once again that the United States is the largest state actor of spying in cyberspace, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said Monday, urging the United States to clarify to the international community on relevant affairs.</p>
<p>
	Reports have emerged that from the Cold War into the 2000s, the U.S. intelligence used the Swiss company Crypto AG's encoding devices to spy on other countries while pocketing millions of dollars.</p>
<p>
	The company sold the devices to foreign governments and companies, and the machines were encrypted but the U.S. intelligence had rigged the devices so they could crack the codes and intercept thousands of messages from more than 120 governments worldwide, according to reports.</p>
<p>
	Geng told an online press briefing that the U.S. government and relevant departments have conducted large-scale, organized and indiscriminate cyber theft, surveillance and espionage on foreign governments, businesses and individuals, which is ""a fact already well-known to all.""</p>
<p>
	It is a tawdry trick that the United States, on the one hand, has been collecting nearly 5 billion mobile phone call records across the globe every day, spying over German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone for more than 10 years, controlling more than 3 million computers in China every year, and implanting Trojan Horse in more than 3,600 websites in China, and on the other hand, enjoys playing victim of cyber attack, just like a thief crying ""stop thief,"" said Geng.</p>
<p>
	The U.S. hypocrisy on the issue of cybersecurity could not be clearer, the spokesman said, stressing that the U.S. has no honor and credibility to speak of in front of other countries.</p>
<p>
	""Facts have proven once again that as the largest state actor of spying in cyberspace, the U.S. is worthy of the name of the 'empire of hackers.' The sky is the limit with the U.S. when it comes to spying,"" said Geng.</p>
<p>
	The spokesman called on the United States to clarify the issue to the international community, noting that an explanation concerning the WikiLeaks and Snowden incidents is still owed. </p>

Let science build strong power against epidemic, 2020-02-18 08:51:15,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	In the era of globalization, human beings are living in a global village where they share the same welfare and responsibilities. The threat posed by any infectious disease is against the entire human race, regardless of nationality, region, ethnicity or group.</p>
<p>
	This is a new challenge faced by the human beings. History cannot be rewound. We should move forward bravely and fight the epidemic. Only by achieving the final victory over the battle against the novel coronavirus pneumonia, can the world, which is shared by all human beings, enjoy a bright future. Chinese President Xi Jinping has stressed that scientific research must be stepped up to defeat the epidemic.</p>
<p>
	“We need your collective knowledge, insight and experience to answer the questions we don’t have answers to,” said Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of the World Health Organization (WHO) when addressing a research and innovation forum on the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>
	His remarks echo the voice from the international community which is coordinating global research power, discovering the focus of research, and developing therapeutic schemes and vaccines. Pulling wisdom to draw the WHO R&amp;D Blueprint, experts from across the world are offering sample tests for countries and regions incapable of such technology, and sharing the latest achievements on epidemiology.</p>
<p>
	The entire science world is conducting cooperation on the most urgent issue, which is closely related to the safety and lives of the people from each country.</p>
<p>
	Cooperation and solidarity are the sharpest weapon against the epidemic, and concerted efforts on scientific research will provide the strongest support. Cooperation is especially important when many countries around the world are seeing the danger posed by the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>
	The WHO research and innovation forum on the novel coronavirus held recently was attended by over 400 deputies, signaling a positive and vital signal to the world when the novel coronavirus pneumonia has spread to over 20 countries and regions. To combat the epidemic calls for coordinated actions of the science world.</p>
<p>
	To cut the spread of the novel coronavirus with the sword of science is a mission that allows no hesitation. China, battling on the frontline, has rapidly integrated scientific power and increased efforts on R&amp;D to enhance development of targeted drugs. It has always followed the principle of opening cooperation and actively conducted international collaboration, making unique contribution to the prevention and control of the epidemic.</p>
<p>
	China’s endeavors aim at the current difficulty, and also an effective mechanism of global synergy for scientific research, epidemic control and clinic treatment. It is recognized by the international society that China has demonstrated its sense of responsibility through its active actions and openness in scientific research as a science power of major influence.</p>
<p>
	Building of a people-oriented community with a shared future for mankind is a major undertaking of the time. In the epidemic, China maintains close cooperation with the world and the world chooses to stand with China. It is for the wellbeing of the human race. China identified the pathogens in record time, shared the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus with the world, and helped other countries create diagnosis kits to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>
	By maintaining close cooperation with the German health department, carriers of the novel coronavirus were quickly discovered and quarantined in Germany. Such open, transparent and responsible practice received high appraise from the WHO. Chinese scientists have gained rich first-hand experiences, which made them important participants and contributors to the WHO R&amp;D Blueprint.</p>
<p>
	“So it’s that kind of solidarity we need, solidarity, solidarity, solidarity,” said Tedros. The awareness of the shared destiny and the spirit of cooperation urged by the WHO are indispensable for human beings to cope with public health challenges. The battles against viruses in human history proved that only through scientific cooperation and sharing the results with the world can people be protected.</p>
<p>
	It will not be forgotten that China’s wide practice of inoculation against smallpox in the 16th century had benefited many countries on the Eurasian continent. It will not be forgotten that China launched its largest-ever overseas medical aid mission when Ebola virus broke out in West Africa in 2014.</p>
<p>
	China was the first to send emergency materials by charter planes and the first to send medical teams to the epidemic zones. It has donated a total of more than $120 million and sent over 1,200 medics to the epidemic zones and 13 surrounding countries.</p>
<p>
	China tested virus samples, sent mobile biosafety labs, aided fixed biosafety labs, and trained local medical and public health personnel. China’s practices, addressing both the urgent demand and long-term issues, were hailed by African countries and the international society.</p>
<p>
	Diseases are public enemy of all the people across the world. It’s a major test of the wisdom and capability of the international society in preventing and controlling the current epidemic.</p>
<p>
	Tedros also repeatedly called on the world to not politicalize science. When racing against the epidemic, the world must join hands and find a solution to eliminate the virus as soon as possible. China is accelerating its actions to build a strong power against the epidemic, and so are the global scientists that respond to the call of justice. </p>

Beijing to build mask factory in 6 days, 2020-02-17 17:02:49,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will convert an industrial building into a new mask factory in six days to meet the surging demand amid the novel coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>
	The factory, being constructed by the China Construction First Group, is expected to produce 250,000 masks per day.</p>
<p>
	Construction started Monday with workers alternating shifts to ensure the project is completed by Saturday. To protect workers from potential infection, the construction company will take temperatures on a daily basis and set aside rooms away from the living areas for workers with symptoms, according to Song Chao, a project manager with the company.</p>
<p>
	As China battles the epidemic, masks have been in great demand by medical workers, disease control personnel as well as the general public.</p>
<p>
	The government has encouraged medical supply manufacturers to step up production among other measures to fill in the supply gap.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Challenging a taboo, the government has proposed a point-based pension system with same rules applying to all, regardless of profession or sector, to replace the current system of 42 regimes.</strong></p>
<p>
	<strong>""Today is the time for responsibility towards the French through a discussion that will take the time it needs,"" said the newly-appointed Solidarity and Health Minister Olivier Veran while addressing the National Assembly.</strong></p>
<p>
	PARIS, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- French lawmakers on Monday began debating the government's draft bill on pension reform, which had brought crowds into the streets and disruptions to transport services in December and January.</p>
<p>
	Defending a reform ""whose ambition is great, even immense,"" the newly-appointed Solidarity and Health Minister Olivier Veran argued that an universal system ""is the pillar of social protection.""</p>
<p>
	""Today is the time for responsibility towards the French through a discussion that will take the time it needs,"" he addressed the National Assembly.</p>
<p>
	Challenging a taboo, the government has proposed a point-based pension system with same rules applying to all, regardless of profession or sector, to replace the current system of 42 regimes.</p>
<p>
	It also plans to end a specific regime for workers of public transport companies RATP and SNCF, which allows train drivers and other staff who work underground to retire at 52 -- a decade earlier than the legal retirement age for a full public pension.</p>
<p>
	Under the new system, every hour worked will earn pension rights, which will benefit gig economy workers who often do not earn enough to lock in pension rights under the current system.</p>

<p>
	""Our predecessors have carried out courageous reforms but always for budgetary reason ... Our reading is broader, our ambition exceeds the balanced budget. It is a social overhaul that the government is proposing,"" Laurent Pietraszewski, secretary of state for pension reform, told lawmakers.</p>
<p>
	Willing to compromise on the disputed reform, the government has offered some concessions including a temporarily removal of ""pivotal age"" of 64, the most contested measure of the reform. It invited unionists to dig for another way to balance the pension deficit during a financing conference. Otherwise, the measure will be added back in before the bill is slated to be voted into law this summer.</p>
<p>
	However, the sweeteners fell short to abate fierce opposition to President Emmanuel Macron's plan to overhaul pension regime.</p>
<p>
	Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of ""France Unbowed"" party, pledged ""tough, relentless and long-lasting"" two-week debate at the National Assembly.</p>
<p>
	""We will do everything we can to prevent this law from being passed,"" he told local media.</p>
<p>
	As the debate in the lower house of the parliament seemed to be heated, trade unions are still a long way from a deal with the government over the planned reform.</p>
<p>
	Unions have planned countrywide protests on Feb. 20. During last two months, large crowds including teachers, civil servants, medical staff, drivers, police and even students had participated in seven separate days of nationwide demonstrations to pressure Macron to reconsider his reform.</p>
<p>
	They say the reform would effectively force people to work longer, in particular public sector workers that have been allowed to retire earlier often because of hard working conditions. The government argued that the costly pension system, which is almost entirely borne by the state, needs to be brought into balance. </p>

	For civil cases of wide public concern such as contract disputes and medical disputes, the circular stressed attaching equal importance to protecting the legitimate rights and interests of workers and safeguarding the healthy development of enterprises.</p>
<p>
	In those cases, local courts are also asked to strengthen the protection of medical personnel and impose harsh punishment on those who produce or sell shoddy epidemic prevention products.</p>
<p>
	Urgent cases can be tried only after proper protective measures are taken, and online trials can be held if possible.</p>
<p>
	The circular covers criminal, civil and administrative matters as well as enforcement and judicial proceedings, among others.</p>

[Chinas leverage in real economy rises in 2019 report], 2020-02-17 15:17:40,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- The leverage ratio of China's real economy increased last year, according to a report released by the National Institution for Finance and Development.</p>
<p>
	The overall debt ratio of households, non-financial enterprises and governments rose to 245.4 percent in 2019, up 6.1 percentage points from the previous year.</p>
<p>
	The rise followed a debt growth slowdown in 2017 and a leverage level drop in 2018. But the increase rate was much lower than that from 2008 to 2016, providing evidence that the country is determined to deleverage.</p>
<p>
	The pickup was mainly driven by households' debt ratio, which rose 3.7 percentage points year on year to 55.8 percent in 2019. Debt ratio of the Chinese government increased 2.1 percentage points during the period, the report said.</p>
<p>
	The non-financial enterprises' debt ratio went up merely 0.3 percentage points during the same period, it said.</p>
<p>
	With looming downward pressures and the impact from the novel coronavirus outbreak, the report predicted China's leverage in real economy would rise by 10 percentage points in 2020.</p>

[Faces in Chinas antiepidemic fight], 2020-02-17 15:24:40,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	WUHAN/CHANGCHUN/NANNING/NANJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak in China is not only taking a hit on the lives of the infected but every one alike. Here are stories of some ordinary Chinese across the nation under the shadow of the epidemic.</p>
<p>
	WUHAN, HUBEI PROVINCE, HEART OF THE EPIDEMIC</p>
<p>
	""Hi, comrades, I haven't peed today,"" Xu Zhaojuan said in a message in a WeChat work group at 8:00 p.m.</p>
<p>
	""My shift began at 3:00 a.m. and I didn't drink water for 10 hours to avoid using the restroom. Although I drank a lot of water after work, I still didn't need to use the bathroom,"" she wrote.</p>
<p>
	Xu, from eastern China's Shandong Province, is among tens of thousands of medics joining the fight against the novel coronavirus in Hubei, the hardest-hit province.</p>
<p>
	""We call each other comrades because we are all super fighters once we put the hazmat suits on,"" she said.</p>
<p>
	China, especially the city of Wuhan, is plagued by the novel coronavirus outbreak that hit in late December when most people were preparing to welcome the Spring Festival, the biggest celebration of the year.</p>
<p>
	The latest figure showed the overall confirmed cases on the Chinese mainland had reached 70,548 by the end of Sunday, with over half in Wuhan. Meanwhile, a total of 1,770 people had died of the disease and 7,264 people were still suspected of being infected with the virus, according to the National Health Commission (NHC).</p>
<p>
	The rise of confirmed cases meant hospitals in Wuhan were severely short of hands and protective gear as some plants suspended operation.</p>
<p>
	As medical workers change their hazmat suit each time they go to the restroom, many medics at the frontline would rather wear diapers and drink little to no water to save the number used. ""The workload of being a nurse is very heavy. I don't even have time to sit down,"" said Xu. ""I'm often dehydrated after wrapping up a day's work.""</p>
<p>
	""This is not a glorious thing,"" she smiled shyly. With that said, she put on her ""superwoman gown"" again and hurried to work.</p>
<p>
	As of Friday last week, China had dispatched a total of 217 medical teams with 25,633 medical workers to central China's Hubei Province to help combat the novel coronavirus. Of them, 20,374 are working in Wuhan, said Wang Hesheng, deputy head of the NHC.</p>
<p>
	BAISHAN CITY, NORTHEAST CHINA'S JILIN PROVINCE</p>
<p>
	""Safe,"" Zhang Xianmin, a local police chief in Fusong County on the foot of the Changbai Mountain, texted his wife late into the night.</p>
<p>
	They have not seen each other for three weeks. Their kids -- an eight-year-old daughter and a 20-month-old son, have been sent to their grandparents in the countryside as the couple is at the frontlines of the battle against the epidemic.</p>
<p>
	Zhang and his colleagues work around the clock and are responsible for inspecting vehicles, taking temperatures for local residents, mediating disputes and assisting the community and the center for disease prevention and control in isolating suspected patients.</p>
<p>
	""We must ensure that every vehicle and resident is covered to curb the spread of the virus to the greatest degree possible,"" he said.</p>
<p>
	Jiao Fei, Zhang's wife, works at the local market regulation department. ""We must guarantee the quality of the products and enough supplies of daily commodities available on the market,"" said Jiao. ""The kids are doing fine at their grandparents' house, set your heart at rest,"" she texted back.</p>
<p>
	Unable to meet while still living in the same city, Zhang and Jiao's story is not an uncommon one as China's battle against the epidemic continues.</p>
<p>
	NANNING, SOUTH CHINA'S GUANGXI ZHUANG AUTONOMOUS REGION</p>
<p>
	Yang Xinfen, 39, took her temperature and was relieved to find it green -- meaning normal. She then put on a mask, took a bottle of alcohol, waved goodbye to her daughter and began a typical day as a part-time food deliverywoman.</p>
<p>
	The sudden outbreak of the novel coronavirus has stricken many unexpectedly and cooped up them at home with inadequate daily commodities. ""In addition to delivering meals, orders for daily necessities and vegetables have increased recently,"" she said.</p>
<p>
	It has been more than three weeks since the Spring Festival, but Nanning, like the rest of the nation, is still exceptionally quiet during the day. But work and life cannot be so easily paused by the virus.</p>
<p>
	Yang soon received an order to pick up Chinese herbal medicines purchased online by a customer. She waited for one and a half hours in the queue and disinfected the package carefully.</p>
<p>
	""We take every precaution for each order and deliver them safely,"" said Yang. ""I got an order days ago for some daily necessities and sent them to Guangzhou. When the order was finished, the customer couldn't stop thanking me. At that moment, I felt that all my hard work was worth it,"" she said.</p>
<p>
	Yang received four orders that day, rode 28 km and came back at around 7 p.m. She parked the car, hung her coat outside the door and sprayed her hands with alcohol before opening the door and reaching out to embrace her daughter.</p>
<p>
	SUZHOU, EAST CHINA'S JIANGSU PROVINCE</p>
<p>
	Yuan Chuanwei has been a one-man show for over 10 days. On Jan. 26, one day after the Spring Festival when he was on vacation in his home city of Yancheng, he received a call for an order for 1,000 hydrogen peroxide sterilizers from his factory in Suzhou. The sterilizers, which were urgently needed in hospitals in Hubei, had to be delivered no later than Feb. 12.</p>
<p>
	The company's employees, mainly from Henan and Fujian, had returned to their hometowns for the Spring Festival, and they did not have enough materials in stock. ""I agreed to produce 200 sets of sterilizers. It's what we can do to contribute to the prevention and control of the epidemic,"" he said.</p>
<p>
	The one-man factory soon began operation. Yuan worked day and night and only took a nap on the sofa when tired. The 200 sterilizers usually take five workers 15 days to finish, and Yuan had them half done in 10 days on his own. ""I can finish it in time,"" he said.</p>
<p>
	Now the equipment has been put into use in hospitals in Hubei, and Yuan is developing a new type of sterilizer. ""I believe that through our efforts, the outbreak will definitely recede and our future will be better and better,"" said Yuan.</p>

[The real meaning of love My story during an epidemic], 2020-02-17 15:56:59,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	I am Bashar Ebrahem. I am from Syria. I came to Wuhan Sports University to get my Ph.D degree in Sports Training in September 2014. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0217/FOREIGN202002171557000508513517803.jpg"" style=""width: 421px; height: 246px;""></p>
<p>
	Every year on Valentine’s Day, I prepare a flower and a small gift for my girlfriend. But this year, love has taken another meaning in my heart. I found myself falling in love with Chinese society, the Chinese teachers and my Chinese friends. Not just because of the respect based on our relationship, but also because I’ve realized that the Chinese people have amazing humanity: they are not only friendly and helpful in normal times, but also willing to offer a sincere helping hand even during their own hard times.</p>
<p>
	From the very first day of the coronavirus epidemic outbreak, we thought our Chinese teachers and friends should be busy taking care of themselves, their families, children and relatives and not pay any attention us. To my astonishment, I started receiving loads of messages from my Chinese friends and teachers asking about my health and safety from the first minute.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0217/FOREIGN202002171656000279124727079.png"" style=""width: 450px; height: 465px;""></p>
<p>
	Our teachers paid extra attention to us from the very beginning of this difficult time. They directed us to stay in our dormitories instead of going outside. The school started offering us all kind of supplies such as food, fruit, masks, liquid soap and other daily living necessities. They also helped us do medical checkups every day. They set up WeChat group for all foreigners staying in school, and the administrators sent us detailed information about the coronavirus, including how to protect ourselves. They cared about us as if we were their own family members.</p>
<p>
	A few days later, some volunteers from the university took the responsibility of bringing vegetables and necessities. Every morning, they called some of us to go to the school supermarket to take whatever we needed. And before we went there, they never forgot to remind us about the safety procedures.</p>
<p>
	Of course it was not their obligation to do that, but they did it voluntarily and responsibly. It was amazing and unbelievable. I totally forgot that I was a foreigner in Wuhan. I just felt I had become a member of a big family in the university and we shared everything together.</p>
<p>
	Furthermore, our teachers never forgot about our mental and physical conditions. Every day, the anti-virus related news was shared and explained in our group chat without any delay. It was the first time in my life I had seen a hospital built in 10 days! During these days, our teachers shared very useful instructions about how to release stress; they encouraged and guided us to do indoor workouts every day. In addition, they sent us some useful links about online study and free online courses. During these days, I have never felt lonely or afraid.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0217/FOREIGN202002171558000018572804027.jpg"" style=""width: 327px; height: 512px;""></p>
<p>
	When my first love Syria (Syrian Embassy) called me from Syria to evacuate me from Wuhan, I decided to stay because of my deep love here, with my Chinese Teachers, with my Chinese friends, with the people of Wuhan, as Wuhan is now my second home. It’s my responsibility to stay with them to go through this hard time. I’m ready to do any volunteer work for the city.</p>
<p>
	I believe the epidemic will be brought under control very soon. The Chinese people’s greatest attribute is their sense of humanity, which will leave a deep impact on my mind forever.</p>
<p>
	Be strong, China! Be strong, Wuhan!</p>

	The argument has been seconded by the World Health Organization (WHO) and institutions in dozens of countries, which have simultaneously called for international cooperation to support China and fight the COVID-19.</p>
<p>
	CALLS FOR EVIDENCE-BASED DECISIONS</p>
<p>
	In a paper published last week on British medical journal The Lancet, scholars argued that imposing travel bans on China is a flagrant violation of the International Health Regulations (IHR).</p>
<p>
	The IHR governs how 196 countries and WHO collectively address the global spread of disease and avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade, stipulating that the measures countries implement when addressing public health risks need to be supported by science, commensurate with the risks involved and anchored in human rights.</p>
<p>
	Citing Article 43 of the regulations, the paper, written by 16 scholars and supported by research institutions in Canada, Britain, the United States, Norway, Switzerland, Italy and so on, argued that the travel restrictions against China are not supported by science, ineffective, and, most importantly, disregarding the dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons.</p>
<p>
	The WHO has said there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade. Addressing the 146th session of the WHO Executive Board meeting earlier this month, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called on all countries to implement decisions that are evidence-based and consistent.</p>
<p>
	Tedros's advise has been echoed by his predecessor Margaret Chan. ""WHO has declared that all countries shall not impose travel or trade restrictions on China. And this is also the spirit of international health regulations valued by the WHO,"" the former director-general has said.</p>
<p>
	COOPERATION RATHER THAN RESTRICTION</p>
<p>
	At a time when many countries have put travel restrictions on China, world experts have voiced support for China and stressed that global cooperation rather than restriction is essential to overcoming the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>
	""Such outbreaks can happen in any parts of the world. Rather than giving pressure to China or suspending the flights and imposing travel bans, the international community should help and cooperate with it in this crisis period,"" said Sundarnath Bhattarai, acting chairman of China Study Center-Nepal.</p>
<p>
	Jennifer Nuzzo, associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the United States should re-examine its approach to the virus crisis, including travel restrictions and suspension of flights.</p>
<p>
	These measures are inconsistent with the advice of the WHO, and unlikely to be effective in stopping the virus from entering the country; instead they will take a toll on the economy and trade, said Nuzzo.</p>
<p>
	Following a special meeting in Brussels on Thursday, European Union Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said the EU is not considering banning Chinese travelers from entering its visa-free Schengen area at the moment, and people should have faith in the measures being taken by member states and China to contain the virus.</p>
<p>
	In Africa, director for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) John Nkengasong said the African CDC is currently coordinating with China to address the novel coronavirus outbreak and warned against baseless fearmongering.</p>
<p>
	""WHO has made it clear there should be no restriction on flights to, in and out of China, and we adhere to the WHO advisory,"" he said.</p>
<p>
	The International Civil Aviation Organization has repeatedly called on its members to follow the travel and health recommendations issued by the WHO and not to impose restrictions inconsistent with the IHR.</p>
<p>
	Other aviation organizations including the International Air Transport Association and Association of Asia Pacific Airlines have also spoken against travel restrictions that disrupt international air transport.</p>

[Service staff at Chinese Hollywood no longer idle despite epidemic], 2020-02-17 14:00:44,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	HANGZHOU, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- Due to the novel coronavirus outbreak, service workers at Hengdian, a major film and television program production center in the city of Dongyang, Zhejiang Province, had an unexpectedly quiet Spring Festival holiday.</p>
<p>
	As most film and teleplay crews suspended shooting, and Hengdian World Studios stopped accepting tourists, service staff began to realize that it was even more ""laborious"" to idle away time than working around the clock.</p>
<p>
	Many of them are from out of town and decided to stay to cash in on the traditional high season. However, sources of income suddenly seemed distant, and returning home has also become not so tempting as traveling is much more difficult during the epidemic.</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile, Hengdian Group DMEGC Magnetics, a local high-tech enterprise manufacturing magnetic materials and other devices, faced the difficulty of labor shortages as many of its employees could not return on time due to temporary traffic bans in their hometowns to curb the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>
	But the company's assembly lines, which were scheduled to resume operation from Feb. 10, cannot wait. The delay would cause serious losses.</p>
<p>
	Apeloa Pharmaceutical and other major companies also faced the same problem.</p>
<p>
	Spontaneously, the companies laid their eyes on the idle employees of Hengdian World Studios and reached out.</p>
<p>
	Starting from Valentine's Day on Feb. 14, Zhang Qiao, a ticket checker at Hengdian World Studios, began checking motor products on an assembly line of DMEGC Magnetics.</p>
<p>
	Many of Zhang's colleagues were offered new jobs such as packaging and pipeline operation after health checks and some trainings on production safety and operation skills.</p>
<p>
	""We have 'borrowed' 180 employees from Hengdian World Studios to work in our factories,"" said Chen Yuyan, assistant to the general manager of TOSPO Lighting.</p>
<p>
	Chen said an employment contract will be signed with each and every ""shared employee"" to ensure their rights and benefits.</p>
<p>
	According to incomplete statistics, nearly 2,000 tour guides, restaurant attendants and ticket-checkers had become factory workers thanks to the ""sharing employee"" scheme in Dongyang as of Feb. 14.</p>
<p>
	""Sharing employees is a bold and beneficial attempt among enterprises, which gives possibilities for freer allocation of short-term jobs,"" said Pan Helin, an expert in economics at Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, who added that the ""self-restructuring"" of productivity is a beneficial exploration to minimize impact from the epidemic.</p>

[Cancer patients more susceptible to novel coronavirus infection research], 2020-02-17 14:36:43,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese medical researchers have discovered that patients with cancer are more susceptible to infection of the novel coronavirus, according to a recent research article in the Lancet Oncology journal.</p>
<p>
	Due to the systemic immunosuppressive state caused by the malignancy and anticancer treatments, such as chemotherapy or surgery, the cancer patients might be at increased risk of the novel coronavirus and have a poorer prognosis, said the article.</p>
<p>
	The research collected and analyzed 2,007 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus infection from 575 hospitals around the country, China Science Daily quoted the article on Monday.</p>
<p>
	The researchers suggested strengthening the monitoring and treatment of elderly cancer patients infected by the epidemic and those having comorbidity.</p>
<p>
	The overall confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus infection on the Chinese mainland had reached 70,548 by the end of Sunday, and 1,770 people had died of the disease.</p>

[China issues over 1600 force majeure slips to coronavirushit companies], 2020-02-17 14:42:26,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- China has issued more than 1,600 force majeure certificates to shield companies from legal damages arising from the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak.</p>
<p>
	The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) has issued 1,615 certificates by last Friday for companies involving over 30 sectors, covering a total contract value of 109.9 billion yuan (about 15.7 billion U.S. dollars), said the CCPIT.</p>
<p>
	The certificate exonerates companies from not performing or partially performing contractual duties by proving they are suffering from circumstances beyond their control.</p>
<p>
	The COVID-19 epidemic has delayed production for some companies as quarantine measures held back many workers from returning to their posts.</p>
<p>
	Some firms have presented the certificate to their clients and agreed on a later date to fulfill orders without facing legal liabilities, said the CCPIT.</p>
<p>
	A manufacturing company in eastern China's Zhejiang Province was the first to obtain the certificate on Feb. 2 to excuse itself from breaching a 2.4-million-yuan overseas order that could incur 30 million yuan of compensation.</p>
<p>
	The CCPIT's force majeure certificates are recognized by governments, customs, trade associations and enterprises of more than 200 countries and regions, it said.</p>
<p>
	To minimize losses for foreign trade companies amid the outbreak, especially from contractual breaches, the Ministry of Commerce has instructed six trade associations in sectors like textile, mining, machinery and healthcare to help with legal counseling and applying for force majeure certificates.</p>
<p>
	Chinese authorities have also urged local officials to help foreign-funded companies with work resumption and operation, with eastern China's Shandong Province rolling out a raft of measures like tax relief and deferring social insurance payments.</p>

China suspends tolls in epidemic prevention period, 2020-02-17 14:44:39,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Transport has decided to scrap all tolls across the country from Feb. 17 to aid smooth supply transportation and work resumption amid the coronavirus epidemic.</p>

[Japanese actor Yano Koji looking forward to see cherry blossoms in Wuhan], 2020-02-17 15:15:51,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- As a Japanese, Yano Koji has seen cherry blossoms numerous times in his home country. But now what he longs to see are the cherry blossoms in Wuhan of southern China.</p>
<p>
	""When the novel coronavirus epidemic is over, I will go Wuhan and enjoy cherry blossoms while sipping my Japanese seishu (a kind of clear liquor),"" he said in an interview with Xinhua.</p>
<p>
	Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province, is the epicenter of the novel coronavirus outbreak where 39,462 confirmed cases were reported as of Sunday, more than half of the total nationwide.</p>
<p>
	The 46-year-old Yano had appeared in many Chinese TV dramas and is one of the most popular Japanese actors in China. After the outbreak, he soon donated 130,000 protective masks to Wuhan. The news went viral and thousands of Chinese web users expressed their gratitude on the twitter-like Sina Weibo.</p>
<p>
	""I learned about the epidemic from news reports and was very worried,"" he recalled. He has some friends in Hubei, and his wife's family is in the adjacent Chongqing municipality.</p>
<p>
	He made the decision that he would do something to help in the battle against the virus. He met with a friend in Japan who could buy protective masks, and help facilitate donating them to those hardest hit by the virus.</p>
<p>
	Due to the size of boxes and relevant regulations in Japan, they used as many as 500 boxes for the 130,000 masks.</p>
<p>
	Packing was a hectic task, which took 10 people almost 20 days to complete. Yano volunteered his time to pack masks whenever he was not working.</p>
<p>
	Reading thankful messages from Chinese people, he said: ""I just did what I should do.""</p>
<p>
	""I began working in China in 2000. Throughout those years I received support and encouragement from many Chinese people, without which I could have never become who I am today,"" he said emotionally. ""I am grateful to China and the Chinese people.""</p>
<p>
	""I feel sad seeing China in such difficulty,"" said Yano. ""In fact what I did is nothing. But I will be happy if I could make my Chinese friends feel warm, even a little bit.""</p>
<p>
	At the request of an interview, Yano at first hesitated. ""While people in China are combating the epidemic, it is not time for a foreign actor to talk.""</p>
<p>
	But he was glad to see the epidemic bring Chinese and Japanese people closer. From Tokyo's iconic Skytree illuminated to symbolize ""be strong, China,"" to the verses on boxes of donated masks to China, Japanese residents touched the Chinese with their timely help and kind words.</p>
<p>
	""Today many Japanese like Chinese culture and are concerned about what's happening in China,"" said Yano. ""We two countries are neighbors and should help each other. When we had difficulties, we received aid from the Chinese as well.""</p>
<p>
	Yano is currently working in Japan on a detective TV show. He was scheduled to take part in the production of a film in March, but the plan was postponed due to the novel coronavirus epidemic.</p>
<p>
	While he has no idea when will his works hit the screen, the actor takes to social media to ask his audiences to protect themselves against the disease. ""Wash your hands frequently, wear masks and take good rest,"" he said. ""You may feel bored confined to your apartment, but there are actually lots of things to do: exercise, learn something new, read a book or watch the movies that you have otherwise no time to watch. The difficult time shall come to an end.""</p>
<p>
	Talking about Wuhan, Yano said he had visited before. ""I traveled there to work and stayed for about a week. I tried local food which was really yummy,"" he said. ""It was a pity that I was too busy then to walk around.""</p>
<p>
	""After the epidemic, I will definitely go there again,"" he said. ""I will sit underneath the trees and enjoy the beauty of cherry blossoms.""</p>

[Foreign students campus life amid epidemic], 2020-02-17 15:16:47,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	TAIYUAN, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- Instead of traveling during the winter vacation, Pakistani student Muhammad Waleed Bin Zafar studied pharmacology for two hours every afternoon.</p>
<p>
	""Now that teachers have told us not to travel, I have more time to spend on my weak subjects in school,"" said Muhammad, majoring in the clinical science of integrated Chinese and Western medicine in the Shanxi University of Chinese Medicine, northern China's Shanxi Province.</p>
<p>
	Due to the spread of the novel coronavirus, Chinese universities have taken comprehensive measures to safeguard the health of international students such as restricting access to outsiders, distributing masks and regularly checking body temperatures.</p>
<p>
	""My campus life has barely changed, except that I make a video call every day telling my family I'm safe,"" Muhammad said.</p>
<p>
	""Faculty workers sterilize our dormitory, and teachers provide authoritative information as well as psychological counseling services. I believe the campus is safer than anywhere else,"" said Afghan student Shadab Abdul Samir from Taiyuan University of Technology (TUT), who described the measures as ""reassuring and necessary.""</p>
<p>
	According to the TUT administration, the school of international exchanges has provided food delivery to the students to avoid cross-infection at the dining hall and uploaded online courses so that the students will not fall behind.</p>
<p>
	Agba Chinaza Frances is a Nigerian student studying in Shanxi University. At the beginning of the epidemic, her mother called her three times a day asking her to go home.</p>
<p>
	""I explained to her what was going on here and what the local government and school had done to protect us,"" she said. ""Traveling is more dangerous, so I'm not leaving.""</p>
<p>
	She said she could finish her assignments in her dorm, and she also does indoor exercises to keep fit.</p>
<p>
	Statistics show some 600 foreign students have stayed on campus in the province, and none of them have been infected so far, according to the provincial education department.</p>
<p>
	""We have already required universities to take full measures since Jan. 21 to ensure the safety of the international students,"" said Han Ruiyong, an official in charge of international affairs from the department.</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile, overseas students are paying close attention to the battle against the epidemic.</p>
<p>
	Muhammad said he was impressed by China's efforts of mobilizing tens of thousands of people for the building of two makeshift hospitals in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.</p>
<p>
	""I've never seen any country mobilize their citizens like China. People from everywhere are rushing to the rescue, and a hospital with 1,000 beds was built in 10 days,"" Muhammad said. ""I don't think there are any difficulties that can defeat Chinese people.""</p>
<p>
	China's daily new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus pneumonia outside Hubei, the epicenter province in the outbreak, have dropped for 13 consecutive days to 115 by Feb. 16, a sharp decrease from 890 on Feb. 3, according to the National Health Commission.</p>
<p>
	Waled Yahya, a TUT doctor student from Libya, said Wuhan was a ""heroic city"" as it had made a tremendous sacrifice to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>
	""When the epidemic is over, I will pay a visit there to figure out what happened and how they triumphed,"" he said.</p>
<p>
	Wuhan, and later a few other cities in Hubei Province, have been sealed off to aid the nation's fight against the coronavirus.</p>

Chinese university develops rapid test kit for novel coronavirus, 2020-02-17 13:57:34,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	TIANJIN, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- China's Nankai University has announced a breakthrough in developing a novel coronavirus rapid test kit that can identify infection among suspected patients within 15 minutes.</p>
<p>
	The new virus detection product, called Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) IgM/IgG antibody detection kit, was developed by the century-old university based in northern China's Tianjin, together with a group of experts from other Chinese universities and biopharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p>
	The fast test card, part of the kit, can detect the virus in just 15 minutes.</p>
<p>
	The test kit can shorten the testing time, provide easier and faster operation and make rapid diagnosis of suspected patients and on-site screening of people in close contact, the university said in a statement.</p>
<p>
	Last week, China's Ministry of Science and Technology solicited research projects on rapid test kits for the novel coronavirus, saying that current nucleic acid detection reagents take a long time and have intricate operations. They are unable to meet the fast-growing needs of the quick testing on suspected patients and asymptomatic infections.</p>
<p>
	A number of research teams across China are developing or have developed rapid testing products for the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>
	The Nankai test kit is expected to be used in epidemic prevention and control soon, the university said.</p>

[Trump Erdogan discuss Syria Libya on phone], 2020-02-17 13:26:11,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	WASHINGTON, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Donald Trump spoke over phone with his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Saturday to discuss issues concerning Syria and Libya, said the White House on Sunday.</p>
<p>
	During their talks, Trump expressed concern over the violence in Idlib, the last rebel-held stronghold in Syria, and called for a political solution to the Syrian conflict, a White House statement said.</p>
<p>
	Trump and Erdogan exchanged views on ending the crisis in Idlib as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
	Earlier on Friday, the Turkish Defense Ministry said 63 Syrian government troops had been killed in Idlib in a Turkish offensive, according to information from various sources.</p>
<p>
	The Russian military on the same day refuted Ankara's claim and warned in a statement that Turkey's accusation ""only aggravates the situation and may lead to hasty decisions that do not meet mutual interests of Russia and Turkey.""</p>
<p>
	Tensions in Idlib have flared up recently as the Syrian government forces, which are launching wide-scale offensives against the rebels in the area, exchanged fire with Turkish troops, causing multiple deaths on both sides.</p>
<p>
	With regard to Libya, Trump reiterated that continued ""foreign interference"" will worsen the situation in the war-torn country, the statement from the White House added.</p>

[Chinas central bank injects liquidity into market], 2020-02-17 11:06:21,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank pumped 100 billion yuan (about 14.33 billion U.S. dollars) into the financial system on Monday.</p>
<p>
	The People's Bank of China (PBOC) injected 100 billion yuan into the market through seven-day reverse repos at an interest rate of 2.4 percent.</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile, a total of 1 trillion yuan of reverse repos matured Monday, resulting in a net withdrawal of 900 billion yuan from the market.</p>
<p>
	The move aims to keep liquidity in the banking system at a reasonably sufficient level, according to a statement on the website of the central bank.</p>
<p>
	A reverse repo is a process in which the central bank purchases securities from commercial banks through bidding, with an agreement to sell them back in the future.</p>
<p>
	In addition, the PBOC injected 200 billion yuan into the market via medium-term lending facility (MLF) Monday, a tool introduced in 2014 to allow commercial and policy banks to borrow from the central bank using securities as collateral.</p>

More than 400 Indians evacuated from Wuhan test negative, 2020-02-17 10:18:32,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	NEW DELHI, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 400 Indian nationals evacuated recently from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the novel coronavirus outbreak, have tested negative for the virus and will be discharged from Monday, India's semi-official news agency Press Trust of India (PTI) reported Sunday.</p>
<p>
	The 406 people have been put under medical observation at a paramilitary quarantine facility in the Indian capital. ""They will be discharged in (a) phased manner from Monday,"" the report added.</p>
<p>
	Officials have said that every member of the group tested negative for the virus twice on Friday.</p>
<p>
	A separate group of Indian nationals was evacuated from Wuhan earlier this month and put under quarantine in an army facility in Manesar in the neighbouring state of Haryana.</p>
<p>
	India has so far reported three confirmed coronavirus cases in the southern state of Kerala, with two patients discharged from hospital after showing signs of recovery.</p>
<p>
	The Indian government on Friday said the novel coronavirus situation in the country was under control, with precautionary measures adopted and effective surveillance in place.</p>
<p>
	India's federal health ministry has launched a 24-hour helpline and is circulating prevention measures recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), which has declared the novel coronavirus epidemic a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC).</p>

[Transmission route for cunning virus remains undecided], 2020-02-17 13:26:34,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p align=""center"">
	<img src=""http://www.people.com.cn/mediafile/pic/BIG/20200217/41/14941839874280677161.jpg""></p>
<p>
	<em>A cured COVID-19 patient waves goodbye to a medical worker at the ""Wuhan Livingroom"" makeshift hospital in Wuhan, central China's Hubei Province, Feb. 15, 2020. Photo: Xinhua</em></p>
<p>
	More encouraging signs have emerged outside of Central China's Hubei Province where the coronavirus originated, yet Chinese experts said it was too early to say that the nationwide battle had decisively turned for the better given no real diminution in infection rates and slow progress in development of antiviral drugs.</p>
<p>
	More importantly, the situation in Hubei continues to be serious. Frontline doctors and experts are cautious in expressing opinion on trend of the epidemic that has been unfolding into a third and fourth generation of cases, and now with a lon-ger-than-expected incubation period and an undecided transmission route.<br>
	<br>
	Some 142 new deaths and 2,009 new infections were reported by the National Health Commission (NHC) on Saturday. Recoveries reached 1,323, the fourth day over 1,000.<br>
	<br>
	Outside Hubei, regions recorded daily decline of new diagnosed infections for the 12th consecutive days since February 3, reflecting that the strict prevention and control measures in Wuhan as well as its surrounding areas have been showing results, according to analysts.<br>
	<br>
	""The downward trend shows that strict measures adopted in the different regions helped contain virus spread in an effective way. The overall medical resources could handle the current situation outside Hubei,"" Wang Guangfa, a respiratory expert at Peking University First Hospital, told the Global Times on Sunday.<br>
	<br>
	However, Wang noted that there has been no unified definition for the highly expected 'inflection point' amid the outbreak.<br>
	<br>
	Outside Hubei, the consecutive declines for more than 10 days could be seen as a turning point for the epidemic in these areas, said Wang.<br>
	<br>
	Severe infection cases have all significantly declined in Wuhan, Hubei and nationwide, Mi Feng, NHC spokesperson, told a press conference on Sunday. The ratio in Wuhan has dropped from a peak of 32.4 percent on January 28 to 21.6 percent on Saturday, while the ratio in Hubei was down from 18.4 percent on January 27 to 11.1 percent on Saturday, according to the NHC figures.<br>
	<br>
	The overall ratio of severe infections in regions outside Hubei dropped from a peak 15.9 percent on January 27 to 7.2 percent on Saturday, the NHC said.<br>
	<br>
	Measures such as self-quarantining, extended Spring Festival holidays and postponing resumption of work have been implemented by provincial and municipality-level authorities over the past few weeks.<br>
	<br>
	Authorities used artificial intelligence and big data-empowered technologies to screen all possible cases and track down suspect patients and their close contacts via community registration and door-to-door inspection.<br>
	<br>
	The consecutive declines in new infections indicated that the current prevention and control measures outside Hubei are effective, Yang Gonghuan, a former vice-director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told the Global Times on Sunday.<br>
	<br>
	The inflection point will probably come when there are no more new cases reported on a daily basis, Yang said.<br>
	<br>
	Wang Xinghuan, director of the newly built Leishenshan Hospital, was quoted as saying in media reports that the inflection point had already arrived in Wuhan. ""The real inflection point [of the outbreak] has come. Over the past 5 days, the number of fever cases has dropped. It is like a downward slope. It's not coming back, I'm confident,"" Wang said.</p>

	<em>Staff members work in a laboratory in Wuhan, central China's Hubei Province, Feb. 13, 2020. (Xinhua/Xiong Qi)</em></p>
<p>
	<strong>Remaining challenges</strong><br>
	<br>
	More recently infected patients appear to have milder symptoms, according to some online posts that cited frontline medical staff dispatched from East China's Shandong Province working in Wuhan.<br>
	<br>
	These anecdotal articles have promoted online speculation that the virulence of novel coronavirus pneumonia, officially known as COVID-19, has been attenuating among the third and fourth generation of infected patients.<br>
	<br>
	Doctors from his team had never published such opinions and such speculation was ""irresponsible,"" Fei Jianchun, who leads the medical team of Qilu hospital from Shandong, was quoted as saying on Sunday after noticing the online trend.<br>
	<br>
	Some analysts noted that the alleged decline in severe cases did not derive from diminished infectivity but more likely from more timely and effective treatment. For now, there has been no evidence suggesting any further mutations of the virus.<br>
	<br>
	""Mutations cannot happen in such a short period and the virulence would not decrease along with its generation transmission,"" said Yang Zhanqiu, deputy director of the pathogen biology department at Wuhan University.<br>
	<br>
	Scientists racing to learn more about COVID-19, which has reportedly killed 1,665 people in China and infected 57,416, describe it as a ""cunning"" virus.<br>
	<br>
	In another worrying anecdotal development about the mysterious behavior of the virus, reports emerged last week of a man who quarantined himself for 14 days in the Shandong city of Rizhao but later displayed classic COVID-19 symptoms of a fever and cough after quarantine period ended. Besides, he wife and two children were all tested positive for the coronavirus but showing no symptoms, Shandong media reported on Saturday.<br>
	<br>
	Meanwhile, the transmission route of the coronavirus has not been completely confirmed. The main routes - respiratory, contact, fecal-oral and aerosol transmission - are all still being studied, Yang said.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Tough battle</strong><br>
	<br>
	The government of Hubei, the province with more than 90 percent of reported new cases nationwide, on Sunday ordered all cities and counties, down to streets, communities and residential districts to seal themselves off.<br>
	<br>
	Daily necessities would be collectively purchased and delivered to those disease-stricken areas, the government statement said. All vehicles, except for ambulances, police vehicles and vehicles used for fighting the disease are banned from the roads.<br>
	<br>
	The extreme measures were a necessary response to those virus-stricken regions which still face a severe situation, the provincial government said in its statement on Sunday.<br>
	<br>
	Wang Hesheng, a member of standing committee of Hubei provincial Communist Party of China (CPC) Committee and head of Hubei health commission, told a press conference Saturday that 25,633 medical staff have been dispatched from regions across the country to support Hubei, a larger number than all the medical personnel mobilized for 2008 Sichuan earthquake.<br>
	<br>
	""Stricter sealed-off management of residential areas at such a critical moment is very important to make sure that all previous efforts don't end in vain,"" a resident surnamed Guo of Yichang, a Hubei city with the fourth-highest number of infected people, told the Global Times on Sunday.<br>
	<br>
	""We can't fight the virus like those frontline doctors and nurses. All we can do is follow the government's regulations and stay at home to help contain the spread of the virus,"" said the resident.</p>

China to step up financial support for epidemic control, 2020-02-17 13:43:15,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- The central fiscal authorities have urged greater efforts to finance the battle against the novel coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>
	The most urgent work for fiscal authorities at all levels is to increase financial input and roll out favorable policies to support epidemic control, said Finance Minister Liu Kun in a written article published on Qiushi Journal, a flagship magazine of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee.</p>
<p>
	As of 9:00 p.m. Feb. 12, China has allocated a total of 78.53 billion yuan (about 11.3 billion U.S. dollars) of fiscal funds to support the control of the epidemic, according to Liu.</p>
<p>
	Supportive measures, including subsidies for medical personnel and tax incentives to manufacturers of epidemic prevention and control materials, should be well implemented, said Liu.</p>
<p>
	Liu stressed that supervision should be strengthened to ensure those in need get the funds.</p>

        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- China has urged local governments, except those in Wuhan and other areas in serious situations, to support the resumption of livestock production amid the fight against the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>
	The animal husbandry sector has been facing problems like feed supply shortages, transportation and sales difficulties, and the lack of workers who can return to work, said a statement issued by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Transport.</p>
<p>
	Local governments should issue supportive measures and allow enterprises, involving feed and livestock and poultry slaughtering and processing, to resume work, and no restrictions such as examinations or approvals should be imposed, the statement said.</p>
<p>
	Priority should be given to ensuring the demand for personnel protection materials and the supply of water, electricity and gas in the enterprises, it said.</p>
<p>
	It also urged the correction of some inappropriate practices, such as blocking roads in some villages, townships and counties.</p>

        <p>
	The 5G technology is playing an increasingly significant role in China’s recent battle against the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0217/FOREIGN202002170954000350319210141.jpg"" style=""width: 490px; height: 314px;""></p>

	<em>Beijing-based Chinese People’s Liberation Army General Hospital has started to carry out its first 5G teleconsultation services with Huoshenshan Hospital, one of the two recently built makeshift hospitals in Wuhan, the epicenter of the novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak in central China’s Hubei province on Feb. 9, 2020.(Photo/Xinhua)</em></p>
<p>
	A 5G network is now covering the whole area of Leishenshan Hospital and Huoshenshan Hospital, two recently built makeshift hospitals in Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus outbreak in central China’s Hubei province.</p>
<p>
	Supported by the network, the Beijing-based Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital launched a 5G teleconsultation system with Huoshenshan Hospital to support the epidemic battle. The system enables doctors in Beijing to establish real-time communications with those in Wuhan.</p>
<p>
	Similarly, Leishenshan Hospital also deploys the 5G network for telemedicine, telesurgery and data transmission to better diagnose and treat patients infected with the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>
	On Feb. 8, Wuhan Union Hospital West Campus and Beijing Chaoyang Hospital started to carry out 5G teleconsultation services, by which two experts analyzed the conditions of two patients.</p>
<p>
	Tong Chaohui, vice president of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, said 5G teleconsultation shows our emphasis on critical patients and will improve the diagnoses and treatment procedures.</p>
<p>
	The application of 5G technology can pool doctors across the whole country together to combat the virus, said Gao Yong, vice president of Wuhan Union Hospital West Campus. Reports confirm that other hospitals in Wuhan have also launched 5G teleconsultation services.</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile, 5G-powered robots have been put into use in hospitals and health service centers in Hubei, Shanghai and east China’s Shandong province with the expectation that they will perform tasks including disinfection and drug delivery, reducing cross-infection risks.</p>
<p>
	The 5G body temperature screening system is also being put into use at public places such as hospitals, railway stations and subways to help fight the epidemic. The system has the capacity to check people’s body temperature and issue warnings automatically.</p>

[Factbox Chinas fight against novel coronavirus outbreak], 2020-02-17 10:11:17,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- China has stepped up efforts to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. Here are the latest developments:</p>
<p>
	-- Hubei announced a slew of wide-ranging and more stringent measures to control the epidemic on Sunday.</p>

<p>
	-- China's top economic planner announced that it would invest 230 million yuan (about 32.92 million U.S. dollars) from the central budget to shore up the battle against the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>
	The investment was allocated for improving conditions of makeshift hospitals converted from public facilities such as gymnasium, increasing their medical equipment and raising their admission capacity, according to the National Development and Reform Commission.</p>
<p>
	-- China reported 2,009 new confirmed cases of novel coronavirus infection and 142 deaths on Saturday from 31 provincial-level regions and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps.</p>
<p>

[US reported ban on plane engines to China selfdestructive experts], 2020-02-17 10:10:50,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<em style=""text-align: center;""><img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0217/FOREIGN202002171010000360293477352.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 300px;""></em></p>
<p>
	<em style=""text-align: center;"">106 model aircraft, one prototype of China's home developed large passenger C919 jetliner, completes its first flight in Shanghai on December 27, 2019, according to the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC). Photo:China News Service</em></p>
<p>
	A US government plan reportedly under consideration to bar US-based firm General Electric Co from selling engines for China's new domestic passenger plane could hurt its own economic interests and credibility and will most likely prompt retaliation from China, Chinese experts said on Sunday.</p>
<p>
	The plan, even if not followed through, marks another escalation in the US' relentless, ill-intentioned campaign to contain China's economic and technological rise following crackdowns on Chinese telecom firm Huawei.</p>
<p>
	It also casts more uncertainty on the otherwise thawing bilateral relationship between the world's two biggest economies, the experts noted.</p>
<p>
	US officials are considering whether to stop US companies, including GE and Honeywell, from supplying engines and other components for China's domestic C919 passenger jet, which is still undergoing flight tests, Reuters reported on Saturday, citing unnamed sources. Discussions among US officials are expected next week and later in the month, Reuters said.</p>
<p>
	As the C919, developed by Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC), relies on some key components from the US, including engine and flight control systems, a potential ban on such sales could affect the development of the widely hailed passenger jet, analysts noted.</p>
<p>
	However, the move will not only be unable to rein in the C919's rise, as intended by US officials, but also hurt the US companies in the long run, according to Wang Yanan, chief editor of Aerospace Knowledge magazine.</p>
<p>
	""There is no benefit here for the US because [the move] will prompt China to look for other suppliers such as engines from Europe. There are ready-to-use products from the UK's Rolls-Royce,"" Wang told the Global Times on Sunday. ""It will also accelerate China's research and development for its own engines.""</p>
<p>
	Part of what has fueled US consideration about banning the airplane component sales to China was worries that such supplies could help China's rise as a competitor to US planemaker Boeing, Reuters noted.</p>
<p>
	The move is also in line with the US government's protectionist and politically motivated trade policies that have not only hurt businesses on both sides but also the global supply chain. It would also create new hurdles for both sides to implement the phase one trade agreement, under which China has agreed to increase certain US imports, according to Gao Lingyun, an expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing.</p>
<p>
	""It's not China that does not want to buy from the US; it's the US that does not want to sell,"" Gao told the Global Times on Sunday, pointing out that the airplane components are not on the list of products the US bans.</p>
<p>
	""If the US continues on this path, then don't take it for granted that China will not also take countermeasures. In fact, there are many things that we can stop selling to the US.""</p>
<p>
	Facing the US' intensifying trade and technology protectionism, Chinese officials have threatened to punish US companies that hurt Chinese interests with an ""unreliable entity list,"" which is still under development. Chinese officials have also suggested limiting rare-earth exports to the US, which are essential to the production of high-tech products, including airplane components.</p>
<p>
	Even without China's retaliation, US companies will bear the dire consequences of the protectionist moves of the US government, said Mei Xinyu, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.</p>
<p>
	""The US' crackdown on China in technologies has made many international buyers realize that US companies cannot be reliable suppliers any longer,"" Mei told the Global Times on Sunday. ""The US can do whatever it wants to do, but it will bear the brunt itself.""</p>
<p>
	US companies, including crisis-hit Boeing, GE and Honeywell, have huge markets in China and losing such a market could exacerbate the downfall of these companies rather than help them, experts noted. </p>

Cured coronavirus patients donate plasma to save more, 2020-02-17 09:29:47,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	WUHAN/SHANGHAI, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- Twenty recovered coronavirus patients donated their plasma to those in severe condition in Wuhan, capital of the hard-hit province of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), said the province's COVID-19 scientific research team Sunday.</p>
<p>
	The donors are doctors and nurses who have recovered from the disease for 10 days at the Jiangxia District's No. 1 people's hospital and traditional Chinese medicine hospital.</p>
<p>
	Twelve patients in severe condition have received the plasma treatment. An expert with Jiangxia District's No. 1 people's hospital said that the patients have shown improved clinical symptoms about 12 to 24 hours after they received the treatment.</p>
<p>
	""We are observing the therapeutic results and improving our treatment plans,"" the expert said, adding that plasma donation won't hurt the donor once he or she has been cured for 10 days.</p>
<p>
	Zhang Dingyu, head of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, a major designated hospital to admit confirmed cases in Wuhan, called upon cured patients who were infected with COVID-19 to donate plasma as initial results had indicated the effectiveness of convalescent plasma-derived therapeutic products in curing infected patients in severe and critical conditions.</p>
<p>
	In Shanghai, official data showed 124 patients have recovered from COVID-19 and discharged from hospitals by Saturday afternoon, of whom 14 have shown willingness to donate their plasma to assist coronavirus research and treatment.</p>
<p>
	Some recovered patients regard the donation as a way to pay back to the society after they received timely and effective treatment.</p>
<p>
	""Before being discharged from the hospital, I learned from the nurses that I can donate plasma, which I think is very helpful,"" said a recovered patient surnamed Liu who is willing to become a donor.</p>
<p>
	""We were helped by others and we want to help other patients as well,"" Liu said.</p>

US should look in the mirror before accusing China, 2020-02-17 10:12:21,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper on Saturday launched a string of attacks against China at the 2020 Munich Security Conference, claiming that China has posed challenges to the world by ""manipulation of the long-standing international, rules-based order.""</p>
<p>
	His accusations are completely groundless. China has always been an advocate of multilateralism as it pursues a community with a shared future for mankind. In contrast, the US is the true challenger to the current world order.</p>
<p>
	US President Donald Trump's administration has formulated and implemented foreign policies under the guidance of the ""America First"" doctrine, placing its own interests above those of all others. In addition, Washington has withdrawn from several international organizations and treaties, as it believes those mechanisms no longer benefit the US itself. All of these moves have greatly disrupted the existing international order.</p>
<p>
	Esper also accused China of ""more predatory economic practices"" and ""a more aggressive military posture"" which is ""most concerning"" for him. Regarding China's economic activities, he accused China of stealing the intellectual property of Western countries. The fact is that many US companies provided China with technologies on their own initiative in exchange for entering the Chinese market. Only recently have they started to make unfounded charges.</p>
<p>
	In terms of China's military, this is not the first time Esper has accused China of ""military expansion."" In December 2019, a spokesman for China's Ministry of National Defense responded to his previous remarks, saying, ""If someone insists on forcing China into being a competitor, then China will certainly be a formidable one."" Washington needs to reflect on its own military behavior. For instance, the Trump administration has established the US Space Force, sparking an arms race in space. Such examples are numerous, giving the US no grounds to find faults with China. The US itself has long sought superiority and has militarized its foreign relations.</p>
<p>
	Since Trump assumed office, US policy toward China has seen an obvious adjustment. It has turned into one that underlines great power competition. High-ranking US officials would miss no opportunity to smear China at international arenas. At the just ended Munich Security Conference, Esper again called on Europe and other countries to ""wake up"" to China's threat. It's obvious that Washington has put great efforts into targeting China, hoping its European allies will help it impede China. At NATO's 70th anniversary summit from December 3 to 4, 2019, the US also attempted to unite its allies by hyping China as a major threat.</p>
<p>
	These nefarious efforts by Esper and other US officials are futile. From my perspective, Europe is indeed waking up, but not to some make-believe China threat. It is becoming aware of the weakness of its own strength, and that it has been overly dependent on the US. Recent remarks by French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have implied that Europe should be more independent and enhance its own power base. I believe the continent will stop pinning its hope on the US and start relying more on itself.</p>
<p>
	The 2020 Munich Security Conference was focused on ""westlessness."" A major cause of ""westlessness"" is the divergence within the Western camp. With the rise of populism and unilateralism inside the US, the traditional values of Europe have suffered huge impacts. As some European scholars put forward, the US has posed many more threats to the West than China or Russia.</p>
<p>
	In response to Esper's arbitrary accusations, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi refuted that Esper and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo ""say the same thing about China wherever they go,"" and laid bare that their words are only lies. He also appealed to all countries to practice multilateralism and get rid of the old divisions that separate the West and the East.</p>
<p>
	It is believed that with China's development and its increasingly significant role in the international community, the world will gradually cast off prejudice, manage differences through cooperation, and eventually build a community with a shared future for humanity.</p>

Community medics commended for coronavirus containment in China, 2020-02-17 09:35:53,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 4 million workers from China's primary-level medical and health institutions have played an important and unique role in the fight against the coronavirus, a health official said Sunday.</p>
<p>
	The medical institutions include both community health service centers in cities and clinics in rural areas, said Zhu Hongming, an official with the National Health Commission, adding that some of them provide round-the-clock services.</p>
<p>
	In the wake of the outbreak, medical workers at the primary level have engaged in timely detections of fever patients and suspected cases to ensure the implementation of isolation and patient transfer, while they also need to carry out daily diagnosis and treatment for common diseases and the management of chronic diseases, Zhu said.</p>
<p>
	The medical workers have conducted carpet screening alongside community workers, informing residents who need to carry out home-based isolation and checking their temperature every day, the official said.</p>
<p>
	Zhu noted that medical workers also work in places with heavy flows of people such as airports and ports to help cut off virus transmission routes at the front lines.</p>
<p>
	To enhance the prevention and control capability of grassroots medics, a special training program was set up on the website for continuing medical education (www.ncme.org.cn), according to Zhu.</p>
<p>
	The online training programme, which consists of one separate section for primary-level medical institutions and another for rural doctors, is open to the public for free, Zhu said.</p>
<p>
	A total of 780,000 grassroots medical workers have received training through the platform to date, he added.</p>

[Chinas Xinzhou700 aircraft development resumed amid epidemic], 2020-02-17 09:37:06,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	Development of China’s Xinzhou-700 aircraft was resumed on Feb.10 as scheduled, thereby entering a new stage of development while the country is simultaneously making great efforts to fight the novel coronavirus epidemic, Science and Technology Daily reported.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">

<p>
	The Xinzhou-700 aircraft is a 70-seat new-generation turboprop regional aircraft developed independently by Aviation Industry Corporation of China, Ltd. (AVIC), a state-owned aircraft manufacturer in China.</p>
<p>
	The aircraft is being developed by AVIC XAC Commercial Aircraft Co., Ltd., a member of AVIC. AVIC XAC Commercial Aircraft Co., Ltd. has so far received orders from 11 clients for 285 Xinzhou-700 planes.</p>
<p>
	Assembly of the aircraft started in 2019, and the docking between the front and middle parts of the fuselage, as well as the fuselage and the nose, were completed successfully last year.</p>
<p>
	The year 2020 is a critical year for the development of the Xinzhou-700 aircraft, as fruitful results are expected to be achieved in the project. At present, final assembly and tail-in work for both the maiden flight and static tests of the aircraft are carried out day and night.</p>
<p>
	“The task of completing airtight testing is urgent. There is a delay in the research progress because of the epidemic. Still, we are making efforts to catch up with the originally intended schedule,” said Han Jiawei, head of the technical team in charge of the final assembly of Xinzhou-700.</p>
<p>
	In an effort to ensure smooth operation of the project amid the current serious epidemic situation, AVIC XAC Commercial Aircraft Co., Ltd. has adopted strict measures covering every aspect in front-line production and companywide management, according to Wang Chengkuan, general manager of the company.</p>
<p>
	All the work areas and offices are completely disinfected at 7 a.m. every day, and all staff members who have returned to their jobs can only enter their workplaces after having their state of health and body temperatures verified.</p>
<p>
	In addition, on-site workers need to have their body temperatures taken in their work areas for the second time, and would only be allowed to work after meeting relevant requirements.</p>
<p>
	AVIC XAC Commercial Aircraft Co., Ltd. has prepared face masks and protective goggles for all staff members who returned to work, and real-time inspection in the workplace of the team in charge of the final assembly is carried out to prevent excessive density of staff members, according to the company. </p>

[Chinas Hubei announces further measures to contain coronavirus outbreak], 2020-02-17 09:37:18,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	WUHAN, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- China's Hubei Province, the center of the novel coronavirus outbreak, announced Sunday a slew of wide-ranging and more stringent measures to control the epidemic.</p>
<p>
	The measures include enforcing province-wide traffic restrictions on all non-emergency vehicles and closing all non-essential public venues, according to a circular issued by the provincial government.</p>
<p>
	The measures came as the province is at a ""critical stage"" to control the epidemic and the situation remains ""grave,"" said the circular.</p>
<p>
	According to the circular, the health screening campaign should be strengthened and no one should be missed. Once any resident shows symptoms such as fever or coughing, the situation should be immediately reported to the local community or village.</p>
<p>
	""Four categories of people,"" namely patients confirmed or suspected to be infected with the virus, their close contacts and patients with fever, should be timely treated or placed in quarantine instead of self-isolation at home.</p>
<p>
	Also, companies should not resume production unless allowed by local epidemic prevention authorities. And those that have resumed work including public institutions, industrial parks and companies should follow strict virus prevention measures.</p>
<p>
	By the end of Saturday, the hard-hit province had reported a total of 56,249 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection. Among the 39,447 hospitalized patients, 8,439 were still in severe condition and another 1,957 in critical condition.</p>

[Annual reports of listed companies highlight resilience of Chinas economy], 2020-02-17 09:44:13,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	Judging from the pre-disclosure of the current annual reports, the overall profit level of A-share listed companies is expected to maintain a steady rise, and the performance of small and medium start-up enterprises has improved significantly.</p>
<p>
	In particular, the vigorous development of the new economy, represented by 5G and new energy vehicles, is injecting more vitality into China's economy and improving its ability to resist risks.</p>
<p>
	WIND statistics show that as of February 13, according to the latest announcement date, 2,282 listed companies on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets have released last year's annual earnings forecasts; another 120 listed companies have disclosed their preliminary earnings estimate, and five companies have disclosed their annual reports.</p>
<p>
	Judging from the performance forecasts that have been disclosed, the overall profit quality of Chinese enterprises, especially listed companies, remains stable and good, indicating that the Chinese economy is still strong and resilient.</p>
<p>
	From the industry point of view, the companies with positive results on the annual reports are mainly concentrated in the industries of construction materials, non-bank finance, electrical equipment, transportation, medicine &amp; biology, and electronics.</p>
<p>
	Affected by the strong rebound in the capital market, the fundamentals of the non-bank financial sector have improved significantly, forecasting a 79 percent year-on-year growth in net profit.</p>
<p>
	Such industries as transportation, construction materials and electrical equipment reported significant improvement in performance, while most other industries also improved to varying degrees.</p>
<p>
	However, the less ideal growth forecast for net profits of steel and leisure services industries led the decline.</p>
<p>
	One of the most noteworthy highlights of the 2019 annual report of A-share listed companies is that the performance of small and medium-sized listed start-up companies has improved significantly, which is not only recognized by many research institutions, but has also become a point of consensus pertaining to the A-share market.</p>
<p>
	Judging from the performance forecasts that have been disclosed at present, the new economy and high-tech industries, which reflect the new momentum of China's economy, are growing rapidly, thus injecting new impetus into the change of the industrial structure of China's economy while also improving its ability to resist risks. </p>

[Desert locusts pose small threat to China official], 2020-02-17 09:44:25,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- The possibility for desert locusts to wreak havoc in China is quite small because of the topography and climate characteristics in the country's border areas, as well as the migration habits of desert locusts, said the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs.</p>
<p>
	Influenced by factors such as abundant rainfall and an extended monsoon season, some countries in East Africa, West Asia and South Asia are currently experiencing seldom-seen plagues of locusts.</p>
<p>
	The migration of desert locusts requires a temperature of about 40 degrees Celsius, and the relative humidity needs to reach 60 percent to 70 percent, said an official with the ministry.</p>
<p>
	Considering the barriers of the Kunlun Mountains and the Himalayas, it is difficult for locusts to cross the cold areas at high altitudes to enter China, the official said.</p>
<p>
	Experts believe there may have been distribution of desert locusts in parts of Tibet Autonomous Region and Yunnan Province in southwest China, which border Nepal and Myanmar, respectively. But the probability of causing harm is very small, said the official.</p>
<p>
	Desert locusts are major agricultural pests in valleys and oases in the tropical desert regions of Africa and Asia. They have a strong flight ability and large appetite and can gather to form huge swarms.</p>

Experts say containing virus requires global cooperation, 2020-02-17 09:06:33,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	NEW YORK, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- Global cooperation is essential to combat the novel coronavirus outbreak, experts have said here.</p>
<p>
	Global public health experts should strengthen information exchange under the close coordination of the World Health Organization (WHO), Huang Yanzhong, a senior fellow for global health at the U.S. nonprofit think tank Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), told Xinhua in a recent interview.</p>
<p>
	As an understanding of the new virus is still rather limited, health experts have to identify various key factors, including the origin, susceptible population and incubation period of the virus, early on in order to quicken the pace of drug and vaccine development, said Huang, who is also professor and director of Center for Global Health Studies at Seton Hall University's School of Diplomacy and International Relations.</p>
<p>
	""It's imperative for the WHO now to assume a leadership role,"" said Huang, adding that there's ""a lot of things that the WHO can do"" including providing guidelines and advisory support on how to tackle the outbreak.</p>
<p>
	Experts said the lockdowns of Wuhan city, the epicenter of the outbreak, as well as of other cities with a large number of infections, have been effective regarding the total number of newly added confirmed cases nationwide in recent days.</p>
<p>
	""The response of the Chinese government in terms of social mobilization and cordoning has been extraordinary. Very few, if any other countries could have done this kind of response,"" said Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>
<p>
	""I don't think there's any doubt that it slowed the spread of the (novel) coronavirus,"" said Frieden at a panel held in CFR's Manhattan headquarters earlier this week.</p>
<p>
	Jennifer Nuzzo, associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said at the same panel that the United States should re-examine its approaches in containing the virus including travel restrictions and suspension of flights, which are inconsistent with the advice of the WHO.</p>
<p>
	Nuzzo said these measures are unlikely to be effective in stopping the virus from entering the country but will take a toll on the economy and trade.</p>
<p>
	""If we stop flights, either because of policy or because nobody's taking these flights anymore due to restrictions, that has consequences for the movement of goods, particularly essential goods, when many companies rely on commercial flights,"" said the senior scholar.</p>
<p>
	Both Frieden and Huang stressed the importance of building trust between health agencies like CDC and the public, mainly through risk communication.</p>
<p>
	The agencies can launch safety awareness campaigns through the timely sharing of any information to the public, said Huang.</p>

Chinese medical team providing quality public health services in Namibia, 2020-02-17 09:45:46,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	WINDHOEK, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- At the Katutura State Hospital Acupuncture Department in Namibia's capital Windhoek, Fang Lianqiang, a Chinese doctor, examined a patient during a consultation.</p>
<p>
	""It's only my third follow-up, and the ankle pain has been relieved after undergoing acupuncture,"" Selma Isack, a patient, said Wednesday.</p>
<p>
	Even though new to Namibia, Fang is already making headway in the provision of public health care.</p>
<p>
	""My passion and mission are to offer excellent care and service to restore the good health of locals through traditional Chinese medicine. I love the people of Namibia,"" Fang said, who is also the chief doctor at the acupuncture department.</p>
<p>
	Fang is part of the 13th batch of Chinese medical team that arrived in Namibia in January this year. The team, composed of two doctors and two nurses, replaced the 12th batch to continue providing health care services at the state hospital.</p>
<p>
	Because he has always aspired to work in Namibia, it is Fang's conviction that Chinese medicine is unique, and can serve the people of the world, including Namibians.</p>
<p>
	According to Fang, the 13th batch is prepared to serve the people of Namibia with professionalism to improve broader public health in Namibia.</p>
<p>
	""We vow to deliver exemplary service to accelerate the provision of health care in Namibia, and help more Namibians get better health,"" Fang added.</p>
<p>
	To achieve this, the team would focus on understanding the country's social dynamics, including enhanced engagement with locals, on learning the culture.</p>
<p>
	""So far, through our patients, we learned that people in Namibia are friendly. We are progressively getting accustomed to the local elements of socialization as well as mastering the general medical care profession standards,"" he added.</p>
<p>
	Moreover, they plan to embark upon robust education to raise awareness about acupuncture.</p>
<p>
	""This is to address the misconceptions, as well as enhance understanding of the local medical fraternity about traditional Chinese medicine,"" he said.</p>
<p>
	The drive, said Fang, is to further build good relations between China and Namibia through people-to-people interaction in health care and beyond.</p>
<p>
	Since 1996, a team of traditional Chinese medical practitioners have been stationed at the Katutura Hospital as part of the cooperative medical projects between China and Namibia.</p>
<p>
	The 12th medical team, which was headed by Chu Hailin since 2018, treated more than 20,000 Namibian patients over a period of a year and half.</p>
<p>
	Ben Nangombe, executive director in the Ministry of Health and Social Services, hailed the contribution made by the Chinese medical team to the country's health sector and wellness of locals.</p>
<p>
	Chinese ambassador to Namibia, Zhang Yiming, said that the Chinese doctors have over the years delivered and sustained quality services beneficial to many Namibians, with the acupuncture department becoming a showcase for China-Namibia ties.</p>
<p>
	""Namibians are healed or relieved from pain, chronic discomfort and other diseases. We are proud that the team has become well-known for their professionalism, devotion and kind-heartedness among Namibian public,"" Zhang said.</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile, the Chinese embassy plans to further strengthen bilateral relations with Namibia and expand cooperation on the health sector to accelerate the provision of health care and more effective medical services.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<em>A doctor talks with his patient via Internet at Jiangsu People's Hospital. (Photo/Xinhua)</em></p>
<p>
	""I once participated in the psychological intervention of Xiaotangshan Hospital in the fight against SARS in 2003. I was well aware of COVID-19’s psychological impact on patients and front-line health care staff, so I called for the establishment of a psychological intervention center in Huoshenshan Hospital a long time ago,"" said Professor Zhu Zhuohong.</p>
<p>
	Professor Zhu, from the Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is one of the project sponsors. He talked about his original intentions surrounding organizing the project.</p>
<p>
	Professor Zhu said that as the epidemic is so severe this time, various provinces and cities across the country have launched a first-level response, especially in Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, where there is great pressure being placed on relevant groups in the process of allowing prevention and control of the epidemic.</p>
<p>
	Patients and front-line health care workers are all vulnerable to the emotional impacts. This point has become the basis for his campaign, stressed Professor Zhu.</p>
<p>
	Professor Zhu further introduced that his work mainly involves coordinating and organizing teams of experts as well as volunteer psychologists. Furthermore, he is responsible for carrying out one-to-one consultations and one-to-many lectures in conjunction with other relevant platforms. </p>
<p>
	At the same time, he also trained volunteers of psychological counselors, supervised difficult cases involving counselors, and received special psychological help cases in Wuhan.</p>
<p>
	The expert lecturers pertaining to these projects mainly stem from universities as well as psychological research institutes, including the Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Department of Psychology of Southwest University, amongst others. </p>

[ITpowered online healthcare services assist Chinas fight against novel coronavirus], 2020-02-17 09:26:30,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- Online healthcare services have been assisting the fight against the novel coronavirus in China, thanks to the application of information technology in medical systems.</p>
<p>
	Based on 5G and other information technology, many Internet healthcare service providers have cooperated with doctors and experts all over the country to provide services such as online consultation, online diagnosis and psychological assistance, making it possible for people to consult with a doctor at home and helping prevent and control the epidemic in an intelligent way.</p>
<p>
	For example, JD Digits, the digital technology arm of Chinese tech giant JD.com, recently launched a type of intelligent robot, which can provide users with online consultation and inform the public about epidemic prevention and control.</p>
<p>
	After learning coronavirus-related knowledge, the artificial intelligence-based robot can perform a basic analysis of users' questions, supporting doctors' diagnosis and treatment. The robot has been applied in the WeChat public accounts or apps of nearly 20 organizations and used by many smart communities.</p>
<p>
	The health branches of Alibaba Group, Baidu and many other Chinese Internet companies have also unveiled intelligent services to answer questions on the epidemic.</p>
<p>
	Online consultation is the first step in digital health, said Li Dewen, deputy director of the information center under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), stressing that efficient human-computer interaction can reduce the workload of hospitals and cut cross-infection risks.</p>
<p>
	Moreover, with the connection to intelligent technology and Internet platforms, medical institutions and doctors are able to provide online diagnosis service, which is key to achieving the informatization of the medical system and digital health in China.</p>
<p>
	A total of 191 public medical institutions and nearly 100 Internet hospitals across the country have made online diagnosis available for people, data from the MIIT showed on Feb. 9.</p>
<p>
	Haodaifu, Chunyuyisheng and Ping An Healthcare and Technology Co. Ltd. have gathered over 10,000 medical professionals in the fields of respiratory systems, infections and internal medicine to provide free consultation and diagnosis for patients.</p>
<p>
	They have also set up hotlines, offering psychological aid for doctors and nurses on the front line of the anti-virus fight.</p>
<p>
	The MIIT said it will work with related departments to promote the application of information technology in the healthcare service sector, while making efforts to increase the use of 5G to boost the informatization of medical systems, the intelligence of medical equipment and the convenience of online medical platforms.</p>

[Chinas catering industry scrambles to minimize impact from virus outbreak], 2020-02-17 09:28:44,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	JINAN, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- Tables were set. Food was ready to be served. For eateries across China, there was only one problem: the diners weren't coming.</p>
<p>
	As China's catering businesses were ready to cash in on the traditional high season during the Spring Festival holiday, a coronavirus outbreak spreading across China has kept customers from dining out, taking a toll on the catering industry and catching restaurant owners off-guard.</p>
<p>
	In 2019, earnings during the Spring Festival holiday accounted for about 15 percent of the total annual revenues of the catering industry, which topped 4.6 trillion yuan (about 667 billion U.S. dollars), according to the China Cuisine Association.</p>
<p>
	Amid the outbreak, nearly all meal reservations and wedding banquets have been canceled and a large number of restaurants suspended operations, according to a report issued by the association on the epidemic's impact on the catering business.</p>
<p>
	Restaurants that previously relied heavily on eating-in earnings had to focus on take-out business, hoping the move could help alleviate the pressure from overhead costs such as rent and labor.</p>
<p>
	A seafood restaurant in the eastern Chinese city of Jinan recently started accepting takeout orders from individual customers and providing set-menu meals for businesses. Yu Tingting, a manager of the restaurant, said daily takeout orders grew to between 40 and 50.</p>
<p>
	To reassure customers that the takeout food is virus-free, many restaurants attached to the delivered food a piece of paper showing the body temperatures of the staff who prepared and delivered it.</p>
<p>
	""Facing great operational pressure, many catering businesses are scrambling to boost their takeout business in an effort to minimize the impact from the virus outbreak,"" said Liu Wenjun, deputy president of a cuisine association in Shandong Province.</p>
<p>
	""While developing their takeout business may be a contingency plan for many restaurants at the moment, it could be an area they could explore in the future,"" said Liu.</p>
<p>
	Online food delivery and ticketing services platform Meituan Dianping has initiated a program providing catering services for enterprises that have resumed operations amid the epidemic.</p>
<p>
	The program can help ensure catering for enterprises while shoring up restaurants that have faced a sluggish market, said an executive with Meituan Dianping.</p>
<p>
	Over 150 catering companies in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen have joined the program.</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile, the sudden surge in the number of people eating at home in China has led to a shortage of deliverymen in many cities.</p>
<p>
	Tech giant Alibaba's Freshhema, a fresh food retailer that offers delivery service, came up with the idea of ""sharing employees"" with restaurant chains to solve the dual problems of the shortage of deliverymen and surplus of restaurant staff.</p>
<p>
	As of Feb. 8, over 1,600 restaurant workers had started their new, short-term jobs with Freshhema in 14 Chinese cities.</p>

[Chinatrained Kenyan scientist promoting knowledge of spiders], 2020-02-17 09:19:40,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	NAIROBI, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- Grace Kioko is currently grappling with immense pressure and expectations, given that she is one of the only two spider scientists in Kenya.</p>
<p>
	The 28-year-old scientist is a pioneer in a field that has been traditionally dominated by men and society has placed unrealistic expectations on her.</p>
<p>
	""There is a lot of pressure because everyone comes to me on issues related to spiders in Kenya. I also like the challenge because it helps me to expound on creatures that have not been exploited as much,"" Kioko told Xinhua in an interview recently.</p>
<p>
	Kioko developed an interest in spiders while working as an intern at the National Museums of Kenya before she got the opportunity to study in China.</p>
<p>
	""I was doing volunteer work at the museum and then I found out that no one was dealing with spiders and so I wanted to fill the gap,"" said Kioko.</p>
<p>
	She was awarded a scholarship to study for a master's degree in spider diversity at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and currently works as a spider taxonomist at the National Museums of Kenya.</p>
<p>
	She said that studying in China was very interesting because she had an opportunity to interact with people from all over the world.</p>
<p>
	""The Chinese also have very specialized laboratories that help in the studying, identification and classification of spiders,"" said Kioko.</p>
<p>
	According to the scientist, studying spiders in Kenya is very difficult as samples typically have to be sent abroad for analysis as the equipment is either expensive to access or is lacking altogether.</p>
<p>
	Kioko is currently identifying and classifying the spider species in Kenya in order to find applications for the insects.</p>
<p>
	Some countries have already been able to commercially exploit their spider species and her hope is to help Kenya do the same, said Kioko.</p>
<p>
	""However, the key challenge remains lack of enough spider scientists locally,"" she said, adding that she is seeking to inspire more Kenyan youth to become spider experts in order to tap the potential of the insects.</p>
<p>
	""I am looking for collaborators so that we can help to enhance our local knowledge of our spider species,"" Kioko.</p>
<p>
	According to Kioko, in Kenya, some 790 species have been classified.</p>
<p>
	""This means that we have a lot of work to do in Kenya in order to catch up with the rest of the world,"" said Kioko.</p>
<p>
	She said that the bulk of Kenya's spider collection is stored outside the country making research of the insect locally to be difficult.</p>
<p>
	The National Museum of Kenya is currently updating its collection of spider species in order to document the country's rich biodiversity.</p>
<p>
	The long-term goal is to put the country's spider inventory on a digital platform so that they are easily accessible from any part of the world.</p>

<p>
	MUNICH, Germany, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 500 high-level international decision-makers gathered over the weekend in Munich to discuss the world's current crises and future security challenges at the annual Munich Security Conference (MSC).</p>
<p>
	This year's agenda was centered on the theme ""Westlessness"", referring to the loss of the common standing of what it means to be part of the West, according to a security report published ahead of the conference.</p>
<p>
	As many participants pointed out, the so-called ""Westlessness"" is essentially a lack of collective action to address the most urgent threats to international security as nations dwell on narrowly-defined national interests and retreat from dialogue and cooperation.</p>

<p>
	""SOUL-SEARCHING"" OF THE WEST</p>
<p>
	The majority of speakers at this year's conference sounded the alarm for the current global security environment. In his opening remarks, MSC chairman Wolfgang Ischinger expressed his disappointment at the lack of collective action to address the most violent crises and most dangerous threats to international peace and security.</p>
<p>
	""It's not enough for the most powerful people in the world to shrug your shoulders and say that this is the way things are,"" Ischinger said, adding that ""the present state of global insecurity is absolutely unacceptable.""</p>
<p>
	German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who delivered an opening speech this year, said that the withdrawal to concentrate on a narrowly-defined national interest prevents the nations from taking joint action and coming up with convincing answers to the issues and problems that no one can solve alone.</p>
<p>
	""The idea of international community is not outmoded,"" Steinmeier said, adding that ""withdrawing into our national shells leads us into a dead end, into a dark age.""</p>
<p>
	Like many European leaders, Steinmeier reflects on the lack of unified action on the European level to address common challenges. ""Each of the major players is pursuing its own advantage even at the expense of Europe's unity.""</p>
<p>
	Echoing Steinmeier, French President Emmanuel Macron, who attended the conference for the first time, called for ""a European strategy"", hoping to see ""a Europe that can protect the basis of its sovereignty, a Europe that has more vitality, and a Europe that is enthusiastic about its future.""</p>
<p>
	Macron said in a dialogue with Ischinger that Europe needs to develop their own European policy, instead of a transatlantic policy, when it comes to relations with neighbors such as the Middle East, Russia and Africa.</p>
<p>
	Gu Xuewu, professor of political science at the University of Bonn, said that discussions on ""Westlessness"" expose problems that currently plague the relations between the European Union and the United States.</p>
<p>
	""There is a sense of loss on the European and American influence in leading global affairs, a loss of trust, and a loss of solidarity between Europe and the United States,"" Gu said, noting that it is difficult for the West to formulate a unified strategy with the ""America First"" policy of the United States in place.</p>

	<em>Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi makes a speech at the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, Germany, on Feb. 15, 2020. (Xinhua/Lu Yang)</em></p>
<p>
	CALL FOR UPHOLDING MULTILATERALISM</p>
<p>
	For some participants, talking about ""Westlessness"" may seem a little self-absorbed, as it is questionable that to which degree the West and Non-West divide is still relevant these days.</p>
<p>
	Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a panel discussion that the core of ""Westness"" is the ""respect for diversity."" The Western model is not the only one that matters in the world.</p>
<p>
	South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said she found the theme of ""Westlessness"" a little insular. Multilateralism is also being practiced by Asian countries, according to Kang, who cited the example of ASEAN centrality.</p>
<p>
	At the conference, the Chinese delegation renewed their call for upholding multilateralism in the face of a complex and changing international environment.</p>
<p>
	""Strengthening global governance and international coordination is urgent right now,"" Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in a speech on Saturday.</p>
<p>
	""We need to get rid of the division of the East and the West and go beyond the difference between the South and the North, in a bid to build a community with a shared future for mankind,"" Wang said.</p>
<p>
	He said that the novel coronavirus epidemic had made mankind realize that it is now an era with traditional and non-traditional security threats being interwoven. A regional issue can be transformed into a global one, and vice versa. No country can stay alone and be immune to the threats.</p>
<p>
	Wang further expounded the concept of multilateralism from the Chinese perspective. Multilateralism denies the priority of a single state and holds that all countries share the same right for development, he told the conference.</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile, the West should also discard its subconscious mentality of civilization supremacy, give up its bias and anxiety over China, and accept and welcome the development and revitalization of a country from the East with a system different from that of the West, said the Chinese top diplomat.</p>
<p>
	Success of multilateralism calls on major nations to play key roles and take major responsibilities. Therefore, big nations must shoulder responsibilities and safeguard the common interests of all countries, Wang also noted.</p>
<p>
	Major nations should strive to maintain the openness of the world, not to confront and counteract each other, and to join hands to safeguard world peace and stability, he added.</p>
<p>
	He said that China will further deepen the strategic partnership of coordination with Russia, continue to explore ways of peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation with the U.S., and will comprehensively deepen cooperation with Europe.</p>
<p>
	At this year's conference, discussions on new security challenges posed by technology, climate change and global health issues underline that need for more cooperation and coordination among nations, as well as among big companies, media and other concerned parties. </p>

<p>

	COVID-19 is a non-traditional security challenge and a major issue mankind is facing, said Hwang Jaeho, dean of the division of international studies at South Korea's Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.</p>
<p>
	Through the fight against COVID-19, China will further promote the modernization of its governance system and capacity, and boost relevant exchanges and scientific research cooperation with other countries, Hwang said.</p>
<p>
	Xi's stress on including biosecurity in the system of national security can help the society take the best response measures timely and orderly when similar situations occur in the future, said Zhao Jun, professor of Japan's Chiba University of Commerce.</p>
<p>
	The emphasis on speeding up establishing a law on biosecurity, which will improve the system of national security, not only marks China as a responsible major country, but also interprets Xi's vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind, said Wang Quancheng, president of the Hua Yuan Association, a non-profit organization serving a new-generation of Chinese immigrants in Singapore.</p>
<p>
	Bai Yi, president of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula Chinese Association, said that improving the mechanism for major epidemic prevention and control will allow China to deal with major public health events more calmly and effectively, and that including biosecurity in the national security system will help safeguard the Chinese people's health and the country's long-term stability, which are very important to China and the world.</p>
<p>
	The measures the Chinese government has taken to improve the mechanism for major epidemic prevention and control and the national public health emergency management system are very timely and necessary, said Li Changhong, executive vice chairman of Kenya Chinese Chamber of Commerce.</p>

	It will improve China's ability to respond to epidemics in the future, reduce the impact of the epidemic on economic development and people's livelihood, and provide experience in response to epidemics for Africa and other underdeveloped countries, Li added.</p>
<p>
	It is a correct step for China to take biosecurity into its national security system, said Volker Tschapke, honorary president of Germany's Prussian Society, adding that it will raise awareness of biological risks among government officials at all levels and the public.</p>
<p>
	""It's a wise decision. The mechanism may prevent and stop potential virus outbreaks,"" said Tschapke.</p>
<p>
	Tursunali Kuziev, a professor at Uzbekistan State University of World Languages, said Xi's move fully demonstrates that the Chinese government attaches great importance to people's lives, health and safety, and once again shows the strength of China's national system to focus on major tasks.</p>
<p>
	Calling the international community to work together to deal with the epidemic, Tursunali expressed his firm belief that ""the Chinese people will win the battle for the prevention and control of the epidemic."" ■</p>

<p>
	A freight train left China's central city of Zhengzhou on Sunday, marking the resumption of Henan Province's exports to Belt and Road countries following the conclusion of the Spring Festival holiday amid the outbreak of the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>
	The train's 41 containers weighing 615.8 tons contain goods such as mechanical and electrical equipment, metal products, precision parts and daily necessities.</p>
<p>
	On Friday, the first China-Europe freight that resumed operations after the Chinese New Year holiday made its departure from the city of Dongguan, south China's Guangdong Province.</p>
<p>
	The cargo includes communication devices, ATMs, circuit boards and vacuum cleaners produced in the Pearl River Delta.</p>
<p>
	The operation of freight trains in Guangdong was suspended due to the holiday and coronavirus epidemic outbreak. The train is expected to arrive in Kaluga, Russia in a fortnight, the China Railway Guangzhou Group said.</p>
<p>
	""With enterprises in the Pearl River Delta resuming operations, there will be more China-Europe freight trains with more containers,"" said Peng Tang of the Guangdong branch of China Railway Container Transport Corporation.</p>
<p>
	Earlier this week, the freight train service from Zhejiang Province to Central Asia also resumed. A train loaded with 82 standard containers left a railway station in the city of Jinhua, eastern China's Zhejiang Province.</p>
<p>
	The cargo including hardware tools, textiles and auto parts is heading to Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and other Central Asian countries through the Horgos Port in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Efforts help enterprises resume work and clearance</strong></p>
<p>
	China has been working hard to fight the outbreak, while seeking to maintain the smooth resumption of work for enterprises.</p>
<p>
	In order to ensure the smooth export of goods, the customs and some other relevant departments made contact with local export enterprises via phone, massaging apps and other means to learn about the impact on their operations of the epidemic, solve any difficulties regarding customs clearance and help enterprises resume production, according to Jinhua customs.</p>
<p>
	Additionally, the department said that it had started conducting a 24/7 clearance mechanism to guarantee effective customs clearance to maintain on-schedule departure of freight trains.</p>
<p>
	The China Europe freight train, also known as China Railway Express, was first launched in March 2011 with just 17 trips all year. Since then, freight volumes have seen a substantial increase with 8,225 trips made in 2019.</p>
<p>
	The first service, then known as the YU-XIN-OU or the Chongqing-Xinjiang-Europe International Railway, began in Chongqing in southwest China before heading to Duisburg in Germany via Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus and Poland.</p>
<p>
	As a crucial part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the network today is composed of 65 domestic lines and links with rail abroad through Alashankou Pass, a major rail port in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Erenhot, as well as Manzhouli in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.</p>
<p>
	There are also freight trains between China and Central Asian countries, departing from Tianjin, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Chengdu and other Chinese cities.  </p>

<p>
	Since the outbreak of the epidemic, China has implemented the most comprehensive and rigorous measures to prevent and control the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>
	Wuhan city, an important transportation hub in central China and capital of Hubei Province, was locked down since Jan. 23, with all public transportation suspended. Several other cities in Hubei Province have followed suit.</p>

<p>
	To improve medical treatment capacity, tens of thousands of workers were mobilized to build two makeshift hospitals in Wuhan with a total of 2,600 beds for patients in serious condition. The construction of each hospital took only 10 days.</p>
<p>
	Provincial-level regions have paired up with cities across Hubei to provide medical aid. A total of 217 medical teams with 25,633 medical personnel have been sent to Hubei as of Friday, with a massive influx of equipment and supplies.</p>

<p>
	The unprecedented moves have yielded positive results. By the end of Saturday, the daily new confirmed cases of the disease outside Hubei have been dropping for 12 consecutive days, with the overall confirmed cases on the Chinese mainland reaching 68,500, according to China's National Health Commission.</p>

	<strong>The rhetoric that some people have used to stigmatize China's quarantine measures ignored the basic laws of epidemic prevention and control in modern society, and worryingly politicized the issue of science.</strong></p>
<p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- As the battle against COVID-19 is at a critical stage, some outside noises have posed a threat of their own.</p>
<p>
	Since the outbreak, China has introduced the unprecedented lockdown of a metropolis at the center of the outbreak, applied stringent quarantine measures across the country, pulled extensive resources into hard-hit areas and shared information with the international community.</p>
<p>
	China made these efforts not only for the sake of its own people, but also for the people of the world. Viruses know no borders. Ensuring the safety of the world's most populous country is a key step to shield people in other countries from further crisis.</p>
<p>
	Faced with the spread of a contagion, relying on our community with a shared future becomes all the more vital.</p>
<p>
	Regretfully, some people outside of China have gotten the wrong message. Out of prejudice or habit, they vilify China's quarantine measures as a violation of human rights, smearing its release of information as not transparent, fanning unnecessary panic and causing overreactions.</p>
<p align=""center"">

<p>
	This rhetoric played up the side-effects of the quarantine, ignored the basic laws of epidemic prevention and control in modern society, and worryingly politicized the issue of science.</p>
<p>
	In fact, China's efforts are paying off. As a professional multilateral organization focusing on public health, the World Health Organization (WHO) sees the whole picture. It praised China's hard work as unprecedented and incredible, having helped prevent large spillover effects to other countries.</p>
<p>
	Outside of China, there are 526 laboratory-confirmed cases from 25 countries and two deaths, according to Feb. 15 figures from the WHO.</p>
<p>
	The Chinese people ""are protecting the world from an even faster spread through their willingness to make sacrifices and their commitment,"" said Michael Schumann, head of the German Federal Association for Economic Development and Foreign Trade. ""They deserve our respect and our active and energetic support.""</p>
<p>
	When people's lives are in peril, discussing how to protect human rights is nothing but empty talk. In the face of a virus epidemic, applying strict quarantine measures is an absolute necessity. Without quarantine, how can people's lives be secured?</p>
<p align=""center"">

	<em>Community workers receive patients who have recovered from novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuchang District of Wuhan, central China's Hubei Province, Feb. 11, 2020. (Xinhua/Cheng Min)</em></p>
<p>
	The speed and transparency of China's response is also impressive. After China detected the outbreak, it isolated the virus, sequenced the genome and shared it with the WHO and the world. The government holds daily briefings and updates the numbers of new infections, deaths and recoveries. It alters the statistical method to help patients get faster access to treatment. As leaders of many foreign governments and international organizations have put it, in many ways, China is setting a new standard for outbreak response. This is no exaggeration.</p>
<p>
	Now, China is fighting two battles: containing the epidemic and restoring momentum in its economy. How to steer the world's second-largest economy through the choppy waters of the epidemic is a severe test for China's decision-makers. China contributes nearly one-third of global economic growth. Properly handling the economy in this critical period will also leave a deep impact on the global economy.</p>
<p>
	Epidemic control is a global issue. Solidarity, not stigma, is needed to fight the common enemy of mankind. Vilification, malicious attacks on China, and politicizing public health issues will only undermine our strength against the virus, risk writing off previous gains, and harm the common interests of the global community.</p>
<p>
	The battle is still intense. It is time to push unhealthy emotions aside, and let science and unity take the lead. </p>

	<em>The novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak has made people realize once again that this is an era in which traditional security and nontraditional security issues are interconnected, and local issues easily become global ones and vice versa, said State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Germany.</em></p>
<p>
	""No country can prosper in isolation or meet all challenges on its own, as our interests are closely interconnected,"" he said. ""Global governance and international coordination must be strengthened without any delay.""</p>
<p>
	Wang called for practicing multilateralism in his speech on Saturday at the 56th Munich Security Conference.</p>
<p>
	As the world has entered the age of globalization, Wang said people must transcend the East-West and North-South divides ""to see our shared planet as a community for all"", and must go beyond the ideological gap and accommodate historical and cultural differences ""to see the international community as one global family"".</p>
<p>
	Speaking on how to better translate multilateralism into action, Wang said countries should pursue shared development, major countries should set a good example, and nations should uphold international norms and see the world as one community.</p>
<p>
	In his speech, Wang also elaborated on the current situation of China's fight against the outbreak under the leadership of President Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>
	The senior diplomat noted that China's rigorous and thorough measures are paying off, and although the epidemic has posed a severe challenge to China's economic and social development, ""the difficulties will be temporary and short-lived"".</p>
<p>
	""With its strong resilience, potential and vitality, the Chinese economy is well positioned to overcome all risks and challenges. The fundamentals sustaining sound economic growth have not changed and will not change,"" Wang said.</p>
<p>
	Quoting the Chinese saying that ""after the storm comes the rainbow"", Wang said the country's pent-up consumer demand and growth potential will be quickly unleashed and the country will enjoy sounder and more sustainable economic and social development.</p>
<p>
	The country has effectively curbed the spread of the outbreak beyond its borders, and ""has made extraordinary efforts and a heavy sacrifice"" for that, Wang said.</p>
<p>
	He added that China is not fighting alone, because the international community has given valuable moral and material support. This joint fight is strengthening the friendship between the Chinese people and peoples across the world, he said.</p>
<p>
	In an interview with Reuters on Friday, Wang said China has won the respect and recognition of the international community with its efforts and even sacrifice in the fight against the novel coronavirus pneumonia.</p>
<p>
	The country has introduced the most comprehensive, stringent and thorough prevention and control measures, such as setting up a nationwide mechanism to mobilize resources from across China, Wang said.</p>
<p>
	Many of the measures, he said, are well beyond what is required by the International Health Regulations and recommendations of the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>
	As a responsible major country, China has from the start acted in an open and transparent manner in releasing related information to the world and seeking international cooperation to prevent the spread of the epidemic worldwide, Wang said.</p>
<p>
	According to the released statistics, the number of confirmed cases outside China is less than 1 percent of the total.</p>
<p>
	""The virus respects no borders. It requires a collective response from the international community,"" Wang said.</p>
<p>
	While some countries are implementing reasonable enhanced inspection measures, Wang said some ""have overreacted"" by adopting measures that have comprehensively stopped people-to-people exchanges or evacuating people from places with only isolated cases or where the epidemic is not severe.</p>
<p>
	""Their overreaction has caused unnecessary panic and is not consistent with the WHO recommendations,"" said the diplomat, adding that there is a question mark on whether such measures contribute to a joint response to the epidemic.</p>
<p>
	""I believe as the epidemic is gradually brought under control, these countries may consider relaxing the restrictions. At the end of the day, normal exchanges and cooperation among countries must be maintained.""</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told Wang at a meeting that Russia intends to continue supporting China in combating the outbreak by providing all forms of support, including sending humanitarian medical equipment.</p>
<p>
	""I would like to express once again our satisfaction with the consistent development of our strategic partnership agreement and confirm our solidarity with China's people and leadership in connection with efforts to eliminate the epidemic,"" Lavrov said.</p>

<p>
	Data from Chinese e-commerce giant Suning.com suggests that sales of several types of health-oriented appliances saw an increase of over 200 percent, including dishwashers, ventilation machines and sterilizers.</p>
<p>
	Sterilization products are also among the most frequently searched types of appliances on many e-commerce platforms.</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile, television sales, which had been through a rough patch recently, have seen a new wave of potential growth, as people are being encouraged to stay at home during the pneumonia outbreak.</p>
<p>
	The number of households using televisions increased by 11 percent over the past Spring Festival, and over 70 percent of household televisions were used for at least five consecutive days, according to the domestic home appliance market monitor All View Cloud (AVC).</p>
<p>
	It is estimated that about 70 percent of domestic appliances will be sold through online platforms in the first three months of this year.</p>
<p>
	Online appliance platforms now require their employees to deliver products without making contact with consumers and to wear masks while installing or repairing products in customers’ houses to ensure their safety.</p>
<p>
	Household appliance manufacturers have also started to provide after-sales services for consumers online and help them solve any issues by showing them online videos, photos, and so on.</p>
