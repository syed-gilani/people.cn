[Commentary Coronavirus wont stop Chinas march towards rejuvenation], 2020-02-18 16:36:41,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- The fight against the coronavirus is a major trial of China's governance system and public health emergency response, and a test of international solidarity in fighting common enemies of humanity as well.</p>
<p>
	Yet the grave challenge that China is tackling, assuredly, will not disrupt the nation's development course -- building a moderately prosperous society in all respects this year and fully building a modern socialist country by the mid-21st century.</p>
<p>
	Throughout its 5,000 years of history, the Chinese nation has never succumbed to difficulties and challenges, internally or externally, including the invasions by imperialist powers in modern times. Entering the 21st century, China has pulled through major risks and challenges such as the SARS epidemic in 2003, the 8.0-magnitude Wenchuan earthquake, and the global financial crisis in 2008. Certainly, the ongoing public health crisis caused by the previously unknown, highly contagious virus, is no exception.</p>
<p>
	Relying on its unique institutional strengths, particularly the highly efficient national mobilization of medics and materials and the pairing-up aid of other provinces in treating patients in affected cities in Hubei Province, China will win the people's war against the novel coronavirus disease, or COVID-19, despite the severity of the current situation.</p>
<p>
	The country's daily new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus pneumonia outside Hubei, the epicenter province of the outbreak, have dropped for 14 consecutive days. Positive results are being delivered with all the unprecedented decisive and stringent measures taken under the centralized, unified leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, such as the city lockdown and the construction of multiple makeshift hospitals. Several local officials, including the Hubei provincial health commission head, were removed from their posts following the outbreak.</p>
<p>
	In another rare move, China mulls postponing its annual ""two sessions"" scheduled for early March -- the meetings of the top legislative and political advisory bodies -- to contain the outbreak.</p>
<p>
	With the comprehensive and extraordinary measures, China has protected its own people and prevented the world from suffering a big catastrophe. In handling this international public health emergency, China is worthy of recognition and support.</p>
<p>
	United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Sunday described the measures put in place by the Chinese government as ""a gigantic effort"" and said the efforts will allow for the progressive reduction of the disease.</p>
<p>
	The control of COVID-19 is at the most crucial juncture for China. The overall confirmed cases on the Chinese mainland had reached 72,436 by the end of Monday, and 1,868 people had died of the disease.</p>
<p>
	Much remains to be learned about the virus, which is more cunning than the one that spread SARS. Critical lessons must be learned from the deadly outbreak.</p>
<p>
	As leading domestic experts believe the virus probably comes from wild animals based on the finding that most early cases were related to a market in Wuhan, capital of Hubei, resolute efforts must be made to eliminate the consumption of wild animals and illegal trade of wildlife.</p>
<p>
	The epidemic exposes inadequacy in China's emergency management and public health. At a meeting of the CPC central committee for deepening overall reform last week, President Xi Jinping stressed the need to strengthen areas of weakness and close the loopholes exposed by the current epidemic.</p>
<p>
	The coronavirus outbreak is expected to prompt an overhaul of the country's emergency and public health management and also push the modernization of China's system and capacity for governance, which is part of the nation's second centenary goal.</p>
<p>
	A Chinese saying goes that trials and tribulations serve only to revitalize a nation. For 1.4 billion Chinese, achieving national rejuvenation is no walk in the park and requires even greater efforts led by the reform-minded CPC.</p>
<p>
	Facing temporary difficulties, many companies in China have made rapid and flexible adjustments in operation and production. It is widely agreed among domestic economists that the outbreak will not undermine the fundamentals of China's highly resilient economy, which contributes around 30 percent of global growth.</p>
<p>
	Going through the trial of the coronavirus outbreak, the united Chinese people are determined to march towards national rejuvenation in a more sound and smart way, while pursuing common prosperity and closer interaction with the world.</p>
<p>
	Tens of thousands of medics in China are racing against time to save the lives of infected people at the risk of their own. Chinese people are grateful for the backing of the international community, especially the aid of urgently needed protective gear for medics from many countries.</p>
<p>
	Zero-sum stragglers should refrain from taking advantage of the epidemic to slander China. Instead, they should think more about how to jointly fight common enemies such as epidemics and terrorism, which are not bound by national borders in the globalized international community.</p>

[COVID19 WHO says it wont further raise global risk level], 2020-02-18 19:30:31,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	The World Health Organization (WHO) said it's getting a clearer picture of the new coronavirus outbreak, how it's developing and where it could be headed, after China released a detailed paper on more than 44,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases on Monday. Based on previous evaluations, the COVID-19 is not a global pandemic, and the WHO will not further upgrade its risk level.</p>
<p>
	WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus deemed the novel coronavirus outbreak a ""public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC)"" on January 30.</p>
<p>
	The WHO said the information gives it a better understanding about the age range of people affected, the severity of the disease and the mortality rate.</p>
<p>
	The data also appears to show a decline in new cases, but the WHO chief said this trend must be interpreted very cautiously.</p>
<p>
	""Trends can change as new populations are affected,"" he said from WHO headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. ""It's too early to tell if this reported decline will continue. Every scenario is still on the table.""</p>
<p>
	Dr. Tedros said the data suggests that the COVID-19 is not as deadly as other coronaviruses including SARS and MERS. According to the WHO, more than 80 percent of the patients only showed mild symptoms of the disease and would recover. In 14 percent of cases, the virus caused serious problems, including pneumonia and shortness of breath, while about five percent of the patients developed critical complications, such as respiratory failure, septic shock and multi-organ failure. The virus is fatal in two percent of the reported cases and the risk of death increases with age.</p>
<p>
	A team of the WHO and Chinese experts have begun field inspections in China. They are expected to travel to Beijing and Guangdong and Sichuan provinces. Guangdong Province ranks second in the number of confirmed cases in China after Hubei, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>
	The joint team of experts will observe the measures that have been put in place to contain and treat the epidemic and evaluate the effectiveness of the said measures. The 12-member team from the WHO, which includes experts from the U.S., arrived in Beijing on the weekend.</p>
<p>
	WHO Health Emergencies Programme Executive Director Dr. Michael Ryan said much of the work so far focused on coming to a consensus on what is and isn't known about the COVID-19.</p>
<p>
	""It's about agreeing what we know, agreeing what we don't know and agreeing what is the best way to access the information we don't know,"" he said. ""The team will then be able to go and visit provinces and see things on the ground.""</p>
<p>
	Once those knowledge gaps are filled, the chances of containing and better treating this disease become much more viable. </p>

Chinese foreign trade companies maintain composure amid epidemic, 2020-02-18 16:20:55,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	China's foreign trade companies have maintained their composure to minimize the negative impact of the coronavirus epidemic by rolling out new business strategies and actively communicating with their overseas customers.</p>
<p>
	Ningbo Jintian Copper (Group) Co., Ltd., one of the largest copper processing companies in China, which exports products to countries including Germany, France and Japan, has resumed production while taking effective measures to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>
	One measure it is taking is encouraging employees to drive or take the company's shuttle buses to work. The buses will be disinfected three times each day, and employees boarding them have to wear masks and have their body temperatures taken. These measures will also be implemented at the workshops. In addition, the company is also offering subsidies ranging from 800 yuan to 1,500 yuan to its staff to help them carry out prevention work.</p>
<p>
	Gaoke Healthcare (Hubei) Co., Ltd. is a leading protective equipment company in central China's Hubei province, where the novel coronavirus broke out, and a first-aid kit supplier for BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Tesla.</p>
<p>
	As its overseas clients are worried about whether the orders can be delivered or that they might be contaminated by the virus, Gaoke has taken the initiative to inform its clients on the progress of its epidemic control measures and the latest production information.</p>
<p>
	""We are also considering delivery of products from other cities to reduce costs of unnecessary checks for the virus,"" the company's head Sui Jianxun said.</p>
<p>
	The machinery company SUMEC Group Corporation (SUMEC) in east China's Jiangsu province, which has markets in 103 countries and regions, has also done a good job in ensuring its operations are continuing amid the epidemic.</p>
<p>
	""We are working overtime to catch up on production, and communicating with our overseas customers to reassure them,"" said SUMEC chairman Yang Yongqing, adding that the company has managed to export 76 containers of goods.</p>
<p>
	Bai Ming, deputy director of the Ministry of Commerce's International Market Research Institute, said foreign trade companies should make the utmost efforts to deliver goods, suggesting that those failing to deliver in time may apply to the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade for force majeure certificates to shield them from legal damages arising from the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>
	Bai also said the relevant government departments should come up with customized preferential policies for foreign trade companies, including granting loans, tax cuts and loan extensions. </p>

China smooths channels to promote farm produce sales, 2020-02-18 16:07:09,"<div class=""wb_12 wb_12b clear"" id=""p_content"">
        <p>
	China has smoothed channels to promote the sale of farm produce stock hit by the coronavirus fallout.</p>
<p>
	Vice Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs Han Jun said Monday that priority should be given to the purchase and delivery of agricultural products produced in impoverished regions and called on e-commerce platforms to open up an anti-epidemic farm produce section to help farmers weather the impact.</p>
<p>
	Affected by the epidemic outbreak, sales of vegetables, fruit and poultry have felt the pinch of blocked transport and sales channels.</p>
<p>
	However, the current issue is just a phase and only seen in some regions with the provinces of Hainan, Yunnan and Hubei as well as Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region being hit the hardest, Han said.</p>
<p>
	He urged local departments to join hands in ensuring the smooth and fast operation of channels for fresh farm produce transport while encouraging authorities to introduce support policies for logistics and subsidize logistics firms and personnel. </p>

[Fact check Is US emergency response system up to par], 2020-02-18 17:11:33,"<div class=""wb_12 clear"">
	<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<script src=""http://tv.people.com.cn/img/player/v.js""></script><script>showPlayer({id:""/pvservice/xml/2020/2/18/fcc7a880-39d8-460b-b81a-e77b91bf1307.xml"",width:800,height:495,skin:2});</script></p>
<p>
	Ever since the novel coronavirus outbreak in China, some US media outlets and politicians have taken advantage of the epidemic to slander the Chinese government and attack China’s political system.</p>
<p>
	Does the US really have a good record in dealing with a similar situation? Let us turn the clock back to 2009, when the H1N1 flu from the US spread to 214 regions and countries.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0218/FOREIGN202002181729000326197501269.jpg"" style=""width: 900px; height: 506px;""></p>
<p>
	The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 60.8 million Americans contracted the H1N1 virus. From April 12, 2009, to April 10, 2010, the virus led to more than 12,000 deaths in a population of 300 million, a number that is hardly on par with the medical standards of a developed nation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0218/FOREIGN202002181732000415229916767.jpg"" style=""width: 900px; height: 506px;""></p>
<p>
	Additionally, CDC estimates that 151,700-575,400 people worldwide died from the H1N1 virus infection during the first year the virus circulated.</p>
<p>
	Well, at least they declared it a public health emergency. However, the US government clearly failed to take enough measures to control it.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0218/FOREIGN202002181732000568614233590.jpg"" style=""width: 900px; height: 506px;""></p>
<p>
	It is confusing that the US seems to have learnt nothing from the epidemic a decade ago. So far, the influenza virus has infected 19 million Americans across the country and killed at least 10,000 people this season alone.</p>
<p>
	Natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina, which hit New Orleans in 2005 and left the city in a desperate state, also demonstrated a “classic failure” or incapacity of the Uncle Sam’s emergency response system.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0218/FOREIGN202002181725000251635670308.jpg"" style=""height: 506px; width: 900px;""></p>
<p>
	On the contrary, China has taken massive efforts to keep the coronavirus under control. Wuhan, a city with a population of over 10 million, and where the coronavirus was initially discovered, is locked down. All citizens in China have been advised to wear masks and many have been encouraged to stay home to prevent the further spread of coronavirus.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0218/FOREIGN202002181733000147673919052.jpg"" style=""width: 900px; height: 506px;""></p>
<p>
	The country is mobilizing medical resources nationwide to aid Wuhan and control the epidemic. As of Feb. 14, a total of 217 medical teams and 25,633 medical professionals were sent to Hubei province, and thousands of military medical experts were deployed to the virus-stricken areas.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/NMediaFile/2020/0218/FOREIGN202002181733000261747675053.jpg"" style=""width: 900px; height: 506px;""></p>
<p>
	Till now, China has contained more than 99 percent of the confirmed cases within its borders, which means less than one percent 1% of confirmed cases worldwide are outside China.</p>
<p>
	Just like WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus said in his speech: “There is a window of opportunity because of the strong measures China is taking at the epicenter, at the source.”</p>
<p>
	Facts and numbers have clearly displayed the truth: China’s speed, scale, and efficiency all demonstrate the strengths of its system.</p>
<p>
	US politicians should stop pointing figures at others, especially if the US government is unable to act in times of public emergency. At the very least, they can shut their mouths if they cannot provide actual help to the world.</p>

        <p>
	BEIJING, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese central authorities vowed to ensure a steady supply of fertilizer in preparations for spring farming amid its fight against the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>
	Solid efforts should be made in encouraging fertilizer enterprises to resume production in a well-organized manner, according to a guideline jointly released by 16 central departments, including the National Development and Reform Commission.</p>
<p>
	Priority should be given to ensure a steady supply of raw materials needed to produce fertilizer, including coal and natural gas, to increase fertilizer output in preparation for spring farming, said the guideline.</p>
<p>
	The guideline also underscored the need to ensure the smooth transportation of fertilizer and called for strengthened coordination of fertilizer reserves and fertilizer imports.</p>
<p>
	Financial institutions are encouraged to increase credit support for fertilizer production and transportation enterprises. Activities including hoarding and price-gouging of fertilizer will be severely punished, said the guideline.</p>
